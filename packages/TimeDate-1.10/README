This is the perl5 TimeDate distribution. It requires perl version 5.003
or later

This distribution replaces my earlier GetDate distribution, which was
only a date parser. The date parser contained in this distribution is
far superior to the yacc based parser, and a *lot* fatser.

The parser contained here will only parse absolute dates, if you want a
date parser that can parse relative dates then take a look at the Time
modules by David Muir on CPAN.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
