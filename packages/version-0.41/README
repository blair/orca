version 0.41
====================

Provides the same version objects as included in Perl v5.9.0 (and hopefully in
the 5.10.0 release).  In fact, if you attempt to use this module with a version
of Perl >= v5.9.0, this module will not do anything, since the code already
exists in the Perl core.

This release changes the behavior of alpha versions with only 1 decimal
place, to make them behave more like their floating-point counterparts.
This may lead to some confusion over the stringified representation of
alpha versions.  See the POD for more details.

IMPORTANT NOTE: version-0.37 introduced a segfault when trying to use the
UNIVERSAL::VERSION routine on modules without a $VERSION scalar.  This was
fixed in version-0.38.

IMPORTANT NOTE2: This version changes the default stringification for some
version objects.  Be sure and read the updated POD for details.  This also
affect the return value of the replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION method.

IMPORTANT NOTE3: The replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION method supplied by this
module currently leaks memory, so don't call it in a loop in your code
until this has been corrected (this is a very uncommon mode of operation,
so it is not as serious a problem as it could be otherwise).

NOT SO IMPORTANT NOTE: The version::AlphaBeta module has been removed from
this distribution and released independently on CPAN.

Please read the POD documentation for usage/details.
