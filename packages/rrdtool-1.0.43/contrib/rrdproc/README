**
**
** This program is a very lightweight collecter for rrdtool. It reads
** and parses /proc/net/dev and sends a rrdtool remote control update
** command to stdout.
**
** rrdproc will sleep a user-defined amount of time between reads from
** /proc/net/dev. This time should match the sample rate you created your
** RRD files with.
**
** Example:
**
** rrdproc --interface=ppp0 \
**         --wait 30 \
**         --filename=/home/djm/traffic-ppp0.rrd | rrdtool -
**
** This will update the RRD file /home/djm/traffic-eth0.rrd with bytes
** received and sent on eth0 every 30 seconds.
**
** rrdproc --interface=eth0 \
**         --wait 300 \
**         --frame \
**         --filename=/home/djm/traffic-eth0.rrd | rrdtool -
**
** Will update /home/djm/traffic-eth0.rrd with counts of framing errors and
** collisions every 5 minutes
