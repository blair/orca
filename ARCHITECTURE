Orca::OpenFileHash
Orca::HTMLFile
Orca::DataFile
Orca::SourceDataFile

This file describes Orca's internal design.

Orca makes use of several internal classes (objects).  They are:

	Orca::OpenFileHash
	Orca::HTMLFile
	Orca::DataFile
	Orca::SourceDataFile is a subclass of Orca::DataFile
	Orca::RRDFile is a subclass of Orca::DataFile
	Orca::GIFFile

Orca::OpenFileHash

	This class provides a cache of open file descriptors to the
	user of the class.  Upon creation, Orca::OpenFileHash is
	told how many open file descriptors to cache.  When a file
	descriptor is needed for a file, the filename is passed to
	a method and if the descriptor is already open, then it
	is given back to the caller, otherwise the file is opened
	and the newly opened descritor is passed back.  If there are
	already a maximum number of file descriptors open, then the
	class closes the least recently used one.

	This class is used by the Orca::SourceDataFile to keep
	files open as Orca waits for file updates.

	constructor	new
	method		open
	method		add
	method		close
	method		change_weight
	method		list
	method		select
	method		get_fd
	method		sysread_readline
	method		is_open
	hidden method	_close_extra

Orca::HTMLFile

	This class is basically a object file descriptor that can be
	printed to.  This class does not provide the same level of
	abstraction that IO::File does.  It only supports the print
	method.

	What this class does is upon creation of an HTML file prints a
	standard amount of HTNL to the beginning of the file.  This
	includes the standard <html> and other tags.  Then, when the
	object is destroyed, the DESTORY method writes some trailing
	HTML to the file.

	constructor	new
	method		print
	hidden method	DESTROY

Orca::DataFile

	Orca::DataFile is a class meant to be subclassed by other
	classes.  What is does is cache file information, such as the
	inode number, the device number of the mount point, the
	files modification time (mtime).  The class can be instructed
	to update the cache upon demand and to return the time when
	the file was last stated.

	The file information is cached to save file access and system
	call overhead that can be prevented.

	constructor	new
	method		filename
	method		file_dev
	method		file_ino
	method		file_mtime
	method		last_stat_time
	method		update_stat
	method		status

Orca::SourceDataFile

	Orca::SourceDataFile subclasses itself from Orca::DataFile.
	This classes primary mission is to load and parse data from
	source text files and hand it off.

	constructor	new
	method		is_current
	method		next_load_time
	method		get_column_names
	method		get_date_column
	method		add_plots
	method		load_new_data
	method		rrds


Orca::RRDFile

	constructor	new
	method		name
	method		rrd_update_time
	method		add_gif
	method		created_gifs
	method		queue_data
	method		flush_data

Orca::GIFFile

	constructor	new
	method		add_rrds
	method		rrds
	method		plot_ref
	method		group
	method		files_key
	method		name
	method		no_group_name
	method		plot_end_time
	method		plot
	hidden method	_plot
	hidden sub	_expire_string
