* Installing the rrdtool module as an embedded extension

Installing rrdtool module as an embedded extension provides all of
your php4 scripts access to the rrd_* functions without having to
load any shared libs with the dl() function of php.  

In order to install the rrdtool module as an embedded extension
you will need to have autoconf/automake and friends installed.

    1. make sure you have the php4 sources untarred somewhere, lets
       call it /src/php-4.2.3/

    2. untar php-rrdtool.tar in the extension directory of the php
       source tree.

            % cd /src/php-4.2.3/ext
            % tar zxvf php-rrdtool.tar.gz

    3. recreate the configure scripts for php4.
    
            % cd /src/php-4.2.3
            % ./buildconf
            
    4. you should now be ready to run configure for php4.
       make sure you include "--with-rrdtool=path" in the options
       where path is the path to where rrdtool is installed to configure.  

            % ./configure --with-rrdtool=/usr/local

    5. now run make, and then make install. you should be ready to go.
