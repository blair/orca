The following people have commit access to the Orca sources.  Note
that this is not a full list of Orca's authors, however -- for that,
you'd need to look over the log messages to see all the patch
contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
orca-dev@orcaware.com, rather than mailing any of these people
directly.

Blanket commit access:
