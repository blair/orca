Linux Orca-aware statistics collector.

This piece of software is for use with Orca, by Blair Zajac
    http://www.orcaware.com/orca/
and intends to provide relevant system statistics in a friendly and
graphical interface.

    Requirements:
        - A running Orca server.
        - Perl 5 installed on target Linux systems.
        - a mechanism for remote distribution of software to send
          collected stats from the target to the server.

          I use rsync, but anything, ranging from ftp to NFS will do fine.

          Check the update_orca_server.sh script (I use it in
          crontab) for reference on doing it.

This software is in alpha stage, so use at your own risk.
