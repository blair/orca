The Devel::DProf package is a Perl code profiler.  This will collect
information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in that
script.

The dprofpp tool is included in this package.

For more information consult the pod in DProf.pm.

Compatibility Notes (by Gurusamy Sarathy and Andreas König):
------------------------------------------------------------

DProf-19970614 will only work with 5.004 and above.  DProf-19970930
does work with 5.004 (stricly speaking), but it has a buggy testsuite
that will fail (correctly) on 5.004.

If you're using 5.003, you need to go back to the previous version on
CPAN (DProf-19960930).  DProf-19970606 and above will only work with
perl 5.004 and later.
