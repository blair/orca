	Fix a bug in lib/Makefile.in where the variable $(CP) was used
	but never defined.

	Fix a bug where watch_data_sources() would do an extra loop
	each time file updates were looked for.

	Version 0.16.

	Update to use RRDtool 0.99.1.

	Version 0.15.

	Create an Orca logo and have the logo appear at the bottom
	of each HTML file.  The logo is stored as hexidecimal inside
	the Orca perl script.

	any more.  Changed it to root@localhost.

	Add a configure script to Orca to make installation of Orca and
	percollator much easier.

	so that percollator runs correctly instead of having to edit
	start_percol, stop_percol, and restart_percol.

	at 1000 character lines that percollator.se generally outputs.

Thu Dec 10 12:50:19 PST 1998
