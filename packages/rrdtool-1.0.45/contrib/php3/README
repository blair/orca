PHP bindings for RRD Tool.

	Contained herein are bindings to allow you to interface
php scripts with RRD tool directly via RRD tool's 'librrd' library,
thus avoiding the need to use system() calls to the rrdtool binary.

	RRD Tool is an AMAZING package of tools to faciliate
the easy storage, retrieval, and graphing of statistics (usually
but not limited to bit/byte counts from routers, switches, and 
hubs).  It was written by the author of MRTG, Tobias Oetiker
(oetiker@ee.ethz.ch).  The primary web site for RRD Tool is:

Reason I wrote this:  Wanted to use PHP to create fairly real-time / 
dynamic web pages w/ RRD tool, but the only way was to use system()
and popen() with PHP, since there was no direct interface to RRD
Tool from PHP.  The fork()ing would have been slow and tedious
so that was pretty much out of the question.  I could have used the 
Perl library (RRDs) to interface ePerl, or mod_perl, or even 
'rrdcgi', but I didn't really want to.  I wanted to use PHP and
there was nothing to change my mind.
