How To Collect Performance Data For Windows 2000/XP Systems
===========================================================

This tool used to be referred to as orcaNT.  It is now named
winallator for two reasons.  First, since it is a data measurement
tool and not a data plotting tool, it deserves a name for a data
gatherer.  Second, the orcaNT portion of the original orcaNT package
was just a patch to orca.pl that removed the call to 'ps aux' and
reducing the package requirements.

To follow in the tracks of the other *allator tools, this package was
renamed winallator.

 1. From a Command Prompt, Cygwin Shell or the Start->Run, type

    perfmon

 2. Click on "Performance Logs and Alerts" and expand on the left hand
    column under "Console Root".

 3. Create a patched copy of Orca.  Currently Orca needs a patched
    version of SourceFile.pm handle the Performance Monitor's log
    files.  This patched version may not work with any other versions
    input data files.

    a) Get a copy of the Orca source tree on the system that will
       process the Winallator log files.

    b) Find the SourceFile.pm-patch-with-r362.txt file and note where
       it is.

    c) cd into the $prefix/lib/Orca directory, where $prefix is where
       you installed your Orca.

    c) Apply the patch by running:

       cp -p SourceFile.pm SourceFile.FCS
       patch -s -p0 < path/to/SourceFile.pm-patch-with-r362.txt

 4. You have two choices now.  The first and easy choice is to load in
    a previously designed log configuration.  You can always modify
    the settings later if you want, using the instructions below for
    the advanced setup.

 5. Simple setup.

    a) Download a copy of the winallator.htm file located in this
       directory to your Windows system.

    b) Right-click on "Counter Logs" and choose "New Log Settings
       From...".  Find and open the downloaded winallator.htm in the
       open file dialog box.

    c) Give the new log settings a name that does not appear in the
       Performance Monitor window and click OK.

    d) The loaded settings here will record a number of different
       measurements into log files in the C:\WinallatorLogs directory.

    e) To end the simple setup, click OK.  Data will be recorded
       immediately into the C:\WinallatorLogs directory.  If they are
       not, then right click on the new Winallator name and select
       "Start". For the advanced setup, continue reading at step 6c.

    f) Click OK to begin recording data.

 6. Advanced Setup.

    a) Right-click on "Counter Logs" and choose "New Log Settings..."

    b) Give the new log settings a name that does not appear in the
       Performance Monitor window and click OK.

         Select counter from the list.

       - Select the instances you want from the list.

    f) Click "Add".  This will add the counter to previous window
