This directory contains several files for getting percollator.se running
on your system.

Tools:
   percol_column
   Perl script to show the contents of only a few columns of data from
   percollator.se output.

When you install the Orca/percollator.se combination, you are going
to be running percollator.se on all systems that you wish to monitor
and running Orca on one host.  The percollator.se programs should all
place their data into a single NFS mounted directory where Orca will
collect it and plot it.  It is not too important that Orca have the
data directory that percollator.se uses locally mounted, since it is
only read.  More importantly are the considerations on where the data_dir
and html_dir.  Please see the descriptions of these options in Orca's
manual page for a more thorough discussion.

To install percollator.se, you need to perform the following steps:

1) Perform the installation instructions as listed on the web page
   http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/performance/se3/

2) Apply the patch file p_netstat_class.se.diff to the
   /opt/RICHPse/include/p_netstat_class.se file using the following
   command

      cd /opt/RICHPse
      patch -s < THIS_DIR/p_netstat_class.se.diff

3) Choose the base directory that will contain the percollator data files.

4) Update the start_percol, stop_percol, and restart_percol files
   set the correct value for the following variables:

   STATSDIR	The base directory for these scripts and data files.
   NCSAHTTPLOG	The location of the web server access_log file.
   AWK		The location of the best awk you have, ie gawk, nawk.

   The start_percol will create a directory STATSDIR/stats_percollator
   where the output data files will be listed.  If you want to change
   this, edit start_percol.

5) Run the start_percol script on each system as root.  It should create
   the needed directories under STATSDIR/stats_percollator.

6) Update the orca/sample_configs/percollator.cfg file to look in the
   new STATSDIR/stats_percollator directory.
