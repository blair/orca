# for use with add_ds.pl script to add datasources to an RRD
#
# usage: ls -1 | ./batch.pl [-o] <# ds to add>
#
# -o will let you overwrite your rrds.  i don't recommend using this 
# switch the first time you run this program.  If something
# gets messed up, the original xml files will be in the xml
# directory and you can run 'rrdtool restore' on all of them
# uncomment the commented out lines below to make this work.
#
# also, you can change the name of the directory the XML is
# getting dumped to, where your rrdtool binary is located, 
# and where add_ds.pl is located.  the variables are listed 
# below.
#
# This script could theoretically take fully-qualified pathnames
# as input from STDIN rather than the output from ls -1.
