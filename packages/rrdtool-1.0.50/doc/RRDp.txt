       With this module you can safely communicate with the rrd-
       tool.

       After every RRRRDDpp::::ccmmdd you have to issue an RRRRDDpp::::rreeaadd com-
       mand to get rrrrddttoooolls answer to your command. The answer is
       returned as a pointer, in order to speed things up. If the
       last command did not return any data, RRRRDDpp::::rreeaadd will
       return an undefined variable.

       If you import the PERFORMANCE variables into your names-
       pace, you can access rrdtools internal performance mea-
       surements.

       use RRRRDDpp
               Load the RRDp::pipe module.

       RRRRDDpp::::ssttaarrtt _p_a_t_h _t_o _r_r_d_t_o_o_l _e_x_e_c_u_t_a_b_l_e
               start rrdtool. The argument must be the path to
               the rrdtool executable

       RRRRDDpp::::ccmmdd _r_r_d_t_o_o_l _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_l_i_n_e
               pass commands on to rrdtool. check the rrdtool
               documentation for more info on the rrdtool com-
               mands.

       $answer = RRRRDDpp::::rreeaadd
               read rrdtools response to your command. Note that
               the $answer variable will only contain a pointer
               to the returned data. The reason for this is, that
               rrdtool can potentially return quite excessive
               amounts of data and we don't want to copy this
               around in memory. So when you want to access the
               contents of $answer you have to use $$answer which
               dereferences the variable.

       $status = RRRRDDpp::::eenndd
               terminates rrdtool and returns rrdtools status ...

       $$RRRRDDpp::::uusseerr,  $$RRRRDDpp::::ssyyss, $$RRRRDDpp::::rreeaall
               these variables will contain totals of the user
               time, system time and real time as seen by rrd-
               tool.  User time is the time rrdtool is running,
               System time is the time spend in system calls and
               real time is the total time rrdtool has been
               running.

               The difference between user + system and real is
               the time spent waiting for things like the hard
               disk and new input from the perl script.
