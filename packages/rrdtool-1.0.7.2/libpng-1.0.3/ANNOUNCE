Libpng 1.0.3 - January 14, 1999

This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the previous public release (1.0.2):

libpng-1.0.3:

  Replaced and extended code that was removed from png_set_filler() in 1.0.1a.
  Fixed a bug in png_do_filler() that made it fail to write filler bytes in
    the left-most pixel of each row (Kevin Bracey).
  Changed "static pngcharp tIME_string" to "static char tIME_string[30]"
    in pngtest.c (Duncan Simpson).
  Fixed a bug in pngtest.c that caused pngtest to try to write a tIME chunk
    even when no tIME chunk was present in the source file.
  Fixed a problem in pngrutil.c: gray_to_rgb didn't always work with 16-bit.
  Fixed a problem in png_read_push_finish_row(), which would not skip some
    passes that it should skip, for images that are less than 3 pixels high.
  Interchanged the order of calls to png_do_swap() and png_do_shift()
    in pngwtran.c (John Cromer).
  Added #ifdef PNG_DEBUG/#endif surrounding use of PNG_DEBUG in png.h .
  Changed "bad adaptive filter type" from error to warning in pngrutil.c .
  Fixed a documentation error about default filtering with 8-bit indexed-color.
  Separated the PNG_NO_STDIO macro into PNG_NO_STDIO and PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO
    (L. Peter Deutsch).
  Added png_set_rgb_to_gray() and png_get_rgb_to_gray_status() functions.
  Added png_get_copyright() and png_get_header_version() functions.
  Revised comments on png_set_progressive_read_fn() in libpng.txt and example.c
  Added information about debugging in libpng.txt and libpng.3 .
  Changed "ln -sf" to "ln -s -f" in makefile.s2x, makefile.lnx, and makefile.sco.
  Removed lines after Dynamic Dependencies" in makefile.aco .
  Revised makefile.dec to make a shared library (Jeremie Petit).
  Removed trailing blanks from all files. 
  Removed misplaced #endif and #ifdef PNG_NO_EXTERN near the end of png.h
  Added "if" tests to silence complaints about unused png_ptr in png.h and png.c
  Changed "check_if_png" function in example.c to return true (nonzero) if PNG.
  Changed libpng.txt to demonstrate png_sig_cmp() instead of png_check_sig()
    which is obsolete.
  Added makefile.hux, for Hewlett Packard HPUX 10.20 and 11.00 (Jim Rice)
  Added a statement of Y2K compliance in png.h, libpng.1, and Y2KINFO.
