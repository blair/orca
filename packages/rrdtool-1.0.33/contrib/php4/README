UPDATES for php4:

    This version of the module will only build for php4/zend.  It will
not build for php3.  Get php3_rrdtool from the rrdtool distribution
if you need the rrd_* functions in php3.  

    The module now contains two ways to install.  The first is as
a self-contained extension (much like the php3_rrdtool module),
and the second is as a php4 embedded extension.  See the INSTALL
file for instructions on how to install in both ways.

    Also fixed some of the scripts in the 'examples' directory. 
A few of them were checking the return value for -1 on some
of the rrd_* function calls.  Most calls will return 0 or 1 to
indicate failure or success, not -1.  Sorry about that.



------------------------------------

PHP bindings for RRD Tool.

    Contained herein are bindings to allow you to interface
php scripts with RRD tool directly via RRD tool's 'librrd' library,
thus avoiding the need to use system() calls to the rrdtool binary.

    RRD Tool is an AMAZING package of tools to faciliate
the easy storage, retrieval, and graphing of statistics (usually
but not limited to bit/byte counts from routers, switches, and 
hubs).  It was written by the author of MRTG, Tobias Oetiker
(oetiker@ee.ethz.ch).  The primary web site for RRD Tool is:
http://www.caida.org/Tools/RRDtool


Reason I wrote this:  Wanted to use PHP to create fairly real-time / 
dynamic web pages w/ RRD tool, but the only way was to use system()
and popen() with PHP, since there was no direct interface to RRD
Tool from PHP.  The fork()ing would have been slow and tedious
so that was pretty much out of the question.  I could have used the 
Perl library (RRDs) to interface ePerl, or mod_perl, or even 
'rrdcgi', but I didn't really want to.  I wanted to use PHP and
there was nothing to change my mind.

BUGS:
     There might be some.  Let me know: joeym@inficad.com.  
Patches to fix bugs you find are more welcome than simple
reports of bugs (I don't have a lot of time to maintain
this code).

	You must include OS, apache version, and method of use
(embedded or self-contained extension) in bug reports.  This
info is important.  Also, give as much detail and examples 
as possible so I can figure out what is wrong =)

THANKS:
	I'd like to thank Jeroen Roodnat for generously helping 
debug the PHP4/Zend version of this module.
