Linux ORCA-aware statistics colector

This piece of software is for use with Orca, by Blair Zajac - http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~blair/orca/ - and intends
to provide relevant system statistics in a friendly and graphical interface.

	Requirements:
		- A running Orca server.
		- perl 5 installad on target linux systems
		- a mecanism for remote distribution of software to send collected stats from de target to the server.
                	I use rsync, but anything, ranging from ftp to NFS will do fine.
			Check the updat_orca_server.sh script (I use it in crontab) for reference on doing it

	Installation:	
		The installation is quite simple.
		- Edit script procallator.pl and adjust the configurable parameters on the beginning of this file
		- Edit install.sh script and check it
		- as root run install.sh
		- configure the distribution mecanism
		- on the server, run orca using the exmple procallator.cfg

This software is in alpha stage, use at your own risk.
