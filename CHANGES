This file is no longer being maintained as of Orca's 0.27b3 release.
The modifications to Orca are now being tracked in the Subversion
source code repository.

You can view Orca's change log in one of two ways:

1) Using a Subversion binary and running

   svn log http://www.orcaware.com/svn/repos/orca/trunk/

   This output will be long, so you may want to pipe it to your
   favorite paging program.

2) Browsing the archives of commit emails sent out from the Subversion
   server when a commit is performed.  The archive is available at

   http://www.orcaware.com/pipermail/orca-checkins/

   You can also put yourself on the Orca-checkins mailing list that
   receives the commit emails by going to

   http://www.orcaware.com/mailman/listinfo/orca-checkins

	  'Available Data Sets' HTML pages, add a link back to the top
	  so that the user does not have to use the browser's back
	  button.  Add '<br /><br />' after any plots so that on the

	* orcallator/orcallator.se:
	  Upgrade to version 1.35.
	    Add a new measurement, the number of secure web server
	      processes on the system using the column name #httpsds.
	      If the environmental variable WEB_SERVER_SECURE is
	      defined, use its value as the regular expression to
	      match on process names.  If WEB_SERVER_SECURE is not
	      defined, then count the number of httpsd's.  New
	      variable www_server_secure_proc_name to hold the regular
	      expression.
	    Increase the maximum number of disks that can be monitored
	      using the RAWDISK code from 512 to 1024 by increasing
	      MAX_RAWDISKS from 512 to 1024.
	    Reformat and modify the usage message to fit the new
	      WEB_SERVER_SECURE environmental variable.
	    (count_procs): Renamed from count_proc.  Take a list of
	      regular expressions to match instead of just one regular
	      expression.  Return the number of process names that
	      match each regular expression in a global integer array,
	      count_procs_results.
	* orcallator/start_orcallator.sh.in:
	  Set WEB_SERVER to httpd and WEB_SERVER_SECURE to httpsd and
	  export them both into the environment for orcallator.se to
	  use.  Add documentation for these two variables.

Wed Aug  7 19:57:45 PDT 2002 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Makefile.in: Restructure the 'all' and 'install' rules so
	  that if make fails in one subdirectory, then the top level
	  'make fail' fails immediately.  Previously, all subdirectories
	  would be built, regardless if there was a failure in any one
	  subdirectory.  Do not do this for 'clean' and 'distclean',
	  because they should always clean up as much as they can,
	  regardless of any sub-make failures.
	* configure.in: Rename all borp_* variables to orca_*.  Fix a
	  spelling mistake for the variable orca_cv_perl_rrds which
	  was preventing RRDtool from being built.

	  Transitional tag.

Mon Jan 14 15:11:36 PST 2002 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/start_orcallator.sh.in: Instead of starting
	  orcallator.se without telling it the measurement interval
	  via the command line and letting it set the default
	  measurment interval of 300, set the default interval in

Fri Nov 16 00:17:10 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Orca/HTMLFile.pm: Make the generated HTML compliant to
	  HTML 4.01.  Make the output font for Blair Zajac's name and
	  email address use "verdana,geneva,arial,helvetica" instead

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Change html_dir from

Wed Oct 24 23:36:31 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Divide the state values in "%g

	  range from 0 to 1, which is expected for a system
	  administrator.

Wed Oct 24 20:24:30 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.32.  Fix a problem where the web access log file pointer
	  instead of the file descriptor was being passed to fstat().
	  Fix a problem where the cached web access log stat()
	  information wasn't being erased if the log file was
	  successfully stat()ed but then fopen() failed.  Rename
	  variables used to keep track of open file pointers and file
	  stat() information to be clearer: ofile to out_log_fp,
	  www_fd to www_log_fp, www_stat to www_log_stat, www_ino to
	  www_log_ino and www_size to www_log_size.  Problem noted by
	  Jeremy McCarty <jeremy@nd.edu>.

Sun Oct 21 14:56:45 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.31.  Instead of naming the output files percol-*, name
	  them orcallator-*.  Always define USE_RAWDISK to use the new
	  raw disk code.  Previously, USE_RAWDISK was defined only if
	  WATCH_OS was defined, but if WATCH_DISK was defined and
	  WATCH_OS was not, then the new raw disk code was not being
	  used.  This change makes the behavior consistent.

Sun Oct 21 14:40:41 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* README: Add wish list URL.

Sun Oct 21 13:01:09 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: The "%g Disk Run Percent" plot
	  was not matching on IDE disks on x86 Solaris systems.  Add
	  an additional regular expression to match these disks.

Fri Oct 19 19:30:26 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Revamp the "%g Subsystem
	  state" plot.  Rename the plot to "%g System Overview" and
	  reorder the subsystems plotted to make more sense.

Fri Oct 19 18:59:10 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

Fri Oct 19 18:17:22 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.30.  Rename the new State_* columns to state_*.

Fri Oct 19 18:16:30 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.30b2.  Output eleven new columns named State_* where each
	  column represents numerically the state of one of the
	  system's substates as they appear in the DNnsrkcmdit output.
	  The character * is replaced with the same character that
	  appears in the DNnsrkcmdit string to represent the
	  particular subsystem.  This can be used to create a single
	  plot that shows how all of the subsystems are performing.
	  The mapping between successive states is exponential, so
	  that as the subsystems get in worse conditions, the plots
	  will show higher values.  Patch contributed by Rusty Carruth
	  <rcarruth@tempe.tt.slb.com>.  Make all of the live_rule.se
	  live and temporary variable names consistent.

Fri Oct 19 18:14:15 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.30b1.  Changed method used by raw_disk_map to detect the
	  end of GLOBAL_disk_info to looking for the first short disk
	  name.  This works for SCSI disks and looking for fd or st
	  devices which should work for EIDE devices.  Patch
	  contributed by Alan LeGrand <alegrand@wallace.com>.

Mon Oct 15 15:28:47 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Orca/OpenFileHash.pm: If a file cannot be opened the

Thu Oct 11 21:51:07 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* FAQ: Answer the question: "Warning: cannot create

	  many open files."

Thu Oct 11 19:13:18 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Add a new orcallator plot
	  titled "%g Subsystem state" which plots a numerical severity
	  level using the subsystem state as determined by SE's
	  live_rules.se class.  How a subsystem state is determined is
	  described here

	    http://www.sun.com/950901/columns/adrian/column1.html

	  but the specific rules for each subsystem on this web page
	  are out of date with respect to the latest SE release.

Thu Oct 11 18:40:55 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* src/orca.pl.in: In Orca's configuration file, instead of
	  defaulting to LINE1 for any data parameters appearing
	  in a plot configuration that does not have its line_type
	  specified, use the last set line_type set in that plot.  If
	  no line_type's are set in a plot, then use LINE1 as the
	  default for all data's in that plot.
	* lib/Orca/Config: Ditto.

Thu Oct 11 16:42:26 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* src/orca.pl.in: Now require Perl version 5.004_05 instead of

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se version
	  1.29.  In SE 3.2.1 stat.se, mknod is a C-preprocessor define
	  to _xmknod on x86 systems while on SPARC systems stat.se
	  declares mknod as a normal function.  When stat.se is
	  included before kstat.se on x86 systems the mknod define
	  causes a compile error on kstat's mknod variables which are
	  part of the ks_rfs_proc_v3 and ks_rfs_req_v3 structures.
	  The work around is to include kstat.se before stat.se.
	* NEWS: Be more specific on what files where changed in the
	  orcallator.se/orcallator.cfg.in section for the changes made
	  in 0.27b2.

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.28b7.
	  Change the output log filename format from percol-%Y-%m-%d
	  to percol-%Y-%m-%d-XXX, where XXX is a number starting at 0
	  that is incremented anytime the number of output columns
	  changes or type of data stored in a column changes.  This is
	  in addition to the creation of a new log filename when a new
	  day starts.  Whenever the program needs to create a new log
	  file for any reason, it will search for the smallest XXX so
	  that there are no log files named
	  percol-%Y-%m-%d-XXX{,.Z,.gz,.bz2}.  If the COMPRESSOR
	  environmental is set and any uncompressed files are found
	  while looking for the smallest XXX, they are compressed with
	  the COMPRESSOR command.
	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Update find_files to find the
	  new log files generated by orcallator.se 1.28b7.

Fri Sep 28 17:13:43 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Add a new plot titled
	  "Processes in Run Queue/Waiting/Swapped" to plot the new
	  data recorded in orcallator.se 1.28b5, #runque, #waiting and
	  #swpque.
	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.28b6.
	  Instead of outputting the number of CPUs only when
	  WATCH_MUTEX is defined, output it when either WATCH_CPU or
	  WATCH_MUTEX is defined.  Only declare and update tmp_mutex
	  if WATCH_MUTEX defined.
	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.28b5.
	  Add three parameters that vmstat outputs, #runque, vmstat's
	  'r' column, which is the number of processes in the run
	  queue waiting to run on a CPU, #waiting, vmstat's 'b'
	  column, which is the number of processes blocked for
	  resourceses (I/O, paging), and #swpque, vmstat's 'w', the
	  number of proceses runnable but swapped out.  Increase
	  MAX_COLUMNS from 512 to 2048.  Check [wr]lentime to see if
	  an EMC is using a fake disk for control.  EMC disks have a
	  fake disk which commands are run over to configure the disk
	  array or to get stats from; they are not real data
	  transfers. They cause 1000 MB/sec writes to appear in the
	  stats.  I still get them but not as often with this bit of
	  code in.  If the I/O which occurred in the last five minutes
	  is not greater than 1/100sec then it is not a very valid
	  stat anyway.  What hapens is that we can have a small I/O,
	  say 1024 bytes, in a 1/100sec = 1024*100/sec.  I am thinking
	  of making it wlentime+rlentime > 2 since I am still geting
	  fake write spikes.  Make sure to define
	  HAVE_EMC_DISK_CONTROL to enable this check.  Patch

	  when reading compressed input data files.  Now when

	  use the new OpenFileHash->is_pipe method to determine if the
	  file descriptor was opened with a bunzip2, gunzip or
	  uncompress pipe, and if so, close the file descriptor, since
	  there cannot be anyway for additional data to appear after a

	  Recoded measure_disk() to access the RAWDISK interface to
	  sys_kstat device information to allow the activity on Sun's
	  A1000 and Clariion Raid controller drives to be seen.
	  Apparently the pseudo drivers do not update the kstat
	  interface.  It is also inverts the fix provided by version
	  1.23 to avoid over-counting md devices.  By suppressing
	  stats from slices and metadevices and instead reporting on
	  full devices such as c0t0d0 or sd0.  Note: This may have
	  introduced an interaction with the live_rules.se class
	  monitoring of drive performance.  Prevent floppy disks and
	  tape drives from RAWDISK.  Added wio% to measure wait time
	  since the idle calculation is wrong without this.  Prevent
	  filesystems mounted under /snapshots from being seen.  Patch

	  column names change or the number of columns increase or
	  decrease.

Tue Mar 27 11:26:39 PST 2001

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Update orcallator.cfg.in to
	  fix a bug in plotting the CPU usage plots where the idle%
	  time was calculated by subtracting the user percent time
	  usr% and the system percent time sys% from 100%.  This did
	  not take into account the wait on IO time wio% that the
	  system measures and hence the idle% was overestimated.  Now
	  plot the correct idle% and the wio%.

Tue Mar 27 11:24:36 PST 2001

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.27.
	  Print the portion of time running in idle mode with some

Fri Mar  2 16:35:20 PST 2001

	* Now the same data expression can be used in plots with
	  different RRD data types (GAUGE, COUNTER, etc.).

Wed Feb 28 10:30:19 PST 2001

	* Remove the "sub_dir" configuration file parameter and now
	  always create sub directories for RRD, image and HTML
	  files.  This removes the problem when a simple Orca
	  configuration file was used and Orca did not create
	  subdirectories and then additional groups where added to the
	  configuration file Orca would begin to use subdirectories
	  and the existing RRD, image and HTML files would be in the
	  wrong location.  In this case, Orca would reload all of the
	  input data.
	* The created HTML files now all include the group name to
	  avoid collisions between the same subgroup name in different
	  groups.
	* The Orca generated RRD filenames had the subgroup name in it
	  which is the same as the directory it is placed in.  Remove
	  the subgroup name from the filename to save memory.  Also,
	  place the group name in the directory's name to prevent
	  collisons between name named subgroups in different groups.

Tue Feb 27 12:15:15 PST 2001

	* src/orca.pl.in: Fix a bug where Orca's documentation states
	  that the configuration file can specify different data_types
	  for each data in a plot but the code did not.  Make the
	  modifications to support this feature.

Mon Feb 26 22:16:17 PST 2001

	* Add a new command line option named -no-images which
	  suppresses image generation.  Remove the command line option
	  -r which told Orca to only update the RRD files and not
	  generate HTML and image files.  To replace -r functionality,
	  use both -no-images and -no-html command line options.
	* Add a new command line option -daemon that puts Orca in the
	  background or daemonizes it.  It is recommended that when
	  this command line option is used that -logfile is used.
	  Patch supplied by Bruce Johnson
	  <Bruce.Johnson@PictureVision.com>.

Mon Feb 26 22:19:56 PST 2001

	* Add a new command line option -logfile that specifies a
	  filename that STDOUT and STDERR are redirected to so that
	  all messages, warnings and errors are printed to the file.
	  Now when a SIGPIPE is caught, messages will continue to be
	  printed unless -logfile was not given to Orca.  Patch
	  supplied by Bruce Johnson <Bruce.Johnson@PictureVision.com>.

Mon Feb 26 13:28:06 PST 2001

	* Include and require Storable 1.0.10.

Sun Feb 25 19:34:32 PST 2001

	* lib/Orca/Config.pm: When loading a configuration file, now
	  do a complete check of it for errors before quitting,
	  instead of quitting after a single error.

Sat Feb 24 13:28:45 PST 2001

	* Fix a bug where Orca's documentation states that the
	  configuration file can specify different data_min and
	  data_max for each data in a plot but the code did not.  Make
	  the modifications to support this feature.

Fri Feb 23 22:32:43 PST 2001

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Greatly simplify
	  orcallator.cfg.in to use Orca's regular expression matching
	  features to make the Interface Bits Per Second plots instead
	  of listing each possible interface.
	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.33.

Mon Feb 19 19:50:19 PST 2001

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.30.

Sat Feb 10 13:14:49 PST 2001

	* orcallator/orcallator.cfg.in: Add input and output bits per
	  second plots to orcallator.cfg.in for ge0, qe0, qe1, qe2,
	  qe3 and vge0 interfaces.

Thu Feb  8 15:55:29 PST 2001

	* By default, now create an hourly plot that shows the last
	  1.5 hours of data.  Add a global "make_hourly_plot"
	  configuration file parameter that turns this plot
	  off.  Hourly plot creation is disabled in orcallator.cfg.in
	  since orcallator.se by default measures the system every 5
	  minutes and the plots look blocky.

Wed Feb  7 16:43:26 PST 2001

	* The previous fix for the
	    'Use on uninitialized value in array element at (eval X)
	    line 1, <DATA> line Y'
	  warning did not work on Perl 5.004_05.  Modify the fix so
	  that it will work on this older version of Perl.

Mon Feb  5 17:27:02 PST 2001

	* orcallator/orcallator.se: Update to orcallator.se 1.26.
	  Make sure to check the return from stat() on the web server
	  access log in case the file is missing.  Use fstat() instead
	  of stat() when a file descriptor is available.

Mon Feb  5 14:48:32 PST 2001

	* src/orca.pl.in: If Orca's output was being piped to a
	  process, such as less, and the process was killed or exited
	  before Orca did, then Orca would not remove the lock
	  directory.  Orca now catches SIGPIPEs and exits cleanly.  If
	  Orca catches any signal other than SIGPIPE, it will print to
	  STDOUT and STDERR some final messages, otherwise it will not
	  print anything, since STDOUT and STDERR may have been
	  attached to a process that exited.

Mon Feb  5 11:59:48 PST 2001

	* src/orca.pl.in: Fix the warning message in src/orca.pl.in
	    'Use on uninitialized value in array element at (eval X)
	    line 1, <DATA> line Y'
	  when Orca was run with Perl 5.6.0.  The problem was that the
	  filename_compare subroutine was eval'ed in Orca::Config
	  while the sort was being performed in the main package and
	  the $a and $b that the compare subroutine expected were not
	  being set.  This problem is probably responsible for
	  problems where there are missing data from the plots.  Since
	  the filename sort tells Orca the order in which to load data
	  into the RRD files and the sort will have newer data files
	  listed before older data files, once newer data is entered
	  into an RRD file you cannot add older data resulting in
	  missing data in the output plots.  The solution to this is
	  to remove the RRD files and rerun Orca with all of the input
	  data files.

Sat Feb  3 12:23:33 PST 2001

	* lib/Orca/Config.pm: Add a new configuration file option
	  named "require" that allows the configuration file to
	  specify the minimum required version of Orca.

Wed Jan 31 15:40:05 PST 2001

	* Add a new configuration file option for plots named
	  summary_format which specifies the format for the summary
	  values as passed to the RRDtool GPRINT function.  The same
	  format is used for each number within a single summary line,
	  but you can specify multiple summary_format options if there
	  are multiple plots on the graph.  The default value, which
	  has not changed from previous Orca versions, is '%9.3lf
	  %S'.  Patch from Alex Howansky <alex@wankwood.com>.

	* Add a new command line option -no-html to instruct Orca to
	  skip generating HTML files.  Patch from Alex Howansky
	  <alex@wankwood.com>.

Wed Jan 31 14:08:24 PST 2001

	* Update all of the www.egroups.com URLs and email addresses
	  to reflect that Egroups was purchased by Yahoo!.

Mon Nov  6 16:38:58 PST 2000

	* Include the orcaservices package in the contrib directory
	  which was written by Carlos Canau <Carlos.Canau@KPNQwest.pt>
	  and documented by Jose Carlos <jcp@KPNQwest.pt>.  This
	  package allows monitoring of many different types of Unix
	  services, such as DNS, SMTP, POP, etc.

	  first tool which is rotates Orca's plots so that daily plots
	  can be archived.  This script is named rotate_orca_graphs.

Thu Oct 26 13:37:38 PDT 2000

	* Add new global configuration file parameters,
	  "make_daily_plot", "make_weekly_plot", "make_monthly_plot",
	  "make_quarterly_plot", and "make_yearly_plot", that when
	  given an argument of 0, do not create the specified plot.

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.21.

Mon Apr 17 10:43:14 PDT 2000

	* Remove the date_format configuration option, as it was never
	  supported.

	* To support converting arbitrary strings in the input source
	  data files that somehow represent time into an Unix epoch
	  time usable by Orca, introduce a new group configuration
	  option named date_parse, which is an arbitrary Perl
	  subroutine that is given two arguments, the first being the
	  name of the file where the data is loaded and the second the
	  string from the 'date_source' column that contains some time
	  information.  The subroutine should return the Unix epoch
	  time.  If this option is not specified, then Orca assumes
	  that the string holds the Unix epoch time.

	  This Perl subroutine is only used if the file's date source
	  is not specified to be the file's last modified time as
	  indicated to Orca by use of the B<date_source> file_mtime
	  configuration file option.

Mon Apr 17 10:43:13 PDT 2000

	* Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.24.  When orcallator.se was
	  running on a system with an older version of SE the
	  p_vmstat.scan variable is an integer and the sprintf to
	  %8.3f fails, resulting in a perceived scan rate of 0 pages
	  per second.  Now always add 0.0 to p_vmstat.scan to get a
	  double.

Sat Mar 11 11:16:49 PST 2000

	* Change the version string from 0.26beta1 to 0.27.

Fri Mar 10 19:00:00 PST 2000

	* Release version 0.26 of Orca.

Thu Mar  9 12:23:24 PST 2000

	* Remove from the INSTALL file the instructions to increase
	  the file descriptor limit to 256.  This should no longer be
	  necessary with the improvements to the code.

Thu Mar  9 12:20:39 PST 2000

	* Reduce the number of open files for the open file descriptor
	  cache from roughly 200 to 100.  Change the code so that if a
	  open of a file or pipe fails, then close two open file
	  descriptors and try again.  It used to be that an attempt
	  would be made if only a pipe failed.

Wed Mar  8 12:02:07 PST 2000

	* Due to some changes at onelist.com, the name of this mailing
	  must change.  The -help at the end of orca-help is being
	  reserved for the mailing list named "orca".  As such, I'm
	  renaming this list to orca-users@onelist.com.  All
	  references to the old name in the package were similarly
	  changed.

Sun Mar  5 20:27:38 PST 2000

	* Include and require Storable 0.6.9.

Wed Mar  1 14:40:26 PST 2000

	* Require the latest versions of all the modules Orca uses.

Wed Mar  1 13:33:00 PST 2000

	* Only build RRDtool if it is needed.

Tue Feb 29 17:43:15 PST 2000

	* To prevent Orca from performing all the gunzip, uncompress,
	  and bunzip2 system calls to get the first line of the source
	  file, store the first line in the state file and use it when
	  constructing the Orca::SourceFile object.

Tue Feb 29 12:16:22 PST 2000

	* Update orcallator.cfg.in to plot the NFS server calls per
	  second and also the v{2,3}{reads,writes}.

Tue Feb 29 12:02:45 PST 2000

	* Update the POD documentation for data_type by copying the
	  exact text from the rrdcreate.pod file.

Sat Feb 26 13:29:16 PST 2000

	* If Orca::OpenFileHash::open tries to open a pipe for
	  compressed input and it cannot be opened, then shrink the
	  maximum number of open file descriptors and close enough
	  descriptors to attempt the pipe again.

Fri Feb 25 17:15:37 PST 2000

	* Upgrade to orcallator.se 1.23.  When orcallator was running
	  on a system with DiskSuite, the same physical disk was
	  listed multiple times when it appeared in several
	  metadevices.  The solution to the problem is not to build
	  the c0t0d0 name but use the long disk name provided by the
	  long_name string.  Patch contributed by Paul Haldane
	  <Paul.Haldane@newcastle.ac.uk>.

	* To facilitate Orca loading in a huge amount of data in one
	  pass, add a new group configuration file parameter that
	  tells Orca how to sort the filenames and when data loaded
	  from them can be flushed to disk.  The new parameters name
	  is "filename_compare" and takes a Perl subroutine that
	  behaves like a subroutine given to sort.  Data is flushed to
	  disk when the subroutine returns a number greater than 1.

Fri Feb 25 16:49:44 PST 2000

	* Save the state more often so that if Orca quits in the
	  middle, it does not have to reload all the data from the
	  files again, even if the data has already been loaded into
	  the RRD files.

Fri Feb 25 16:35:29 PST 2000

	* Have configure determine the best ps commmand to run to get
	  information on the current running Orca process.

	* Finish splitting up the monolithic orca.pl.in into separate
	  modules.

Fri Feb 25 12:44:43 PST 2000

	* start_orcallator.sh refers to percollator.  Change it to refer
	  to orcallator.

	* If two different groups had the same subgroup, then Orca
	  would list both group's subgroup file IDs for both
	  subgroups.  Fix this bug.

	* Rename Orca::FileIDs to Orca::SourceFileIDs.

Fri Feb 18 13:00:19 PST 2000

	* Apply a patch to Orca::ImageFile so that the legends are
	  properly created with the newer RRDtool.

Fri Feb 18 12:19:14 PST 2000

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.13.

Thu Feb 17 13:13:39 PST 2000

	* Include orcallator.se 1.22, which includes the following
	  changes: Include code to record NFS v2 and v3 server
	  statistics.  The new statistics are: nfss_calls, the number
	  of NFS calls to the NFS server, nfss_bad, the number of bad
	  NFS calls per second, and v{2,3}{reads,writes}, which are
	  nfss_calls broken down into NFS version 2 and NFS version 3
	  calls.  The sum of v{2,3}{reads, writes} will be less than
	  nfss_calls as the other types of NFS calls, such as getattr
	  and lookup, are not included.  Contributed by Paul Haldane
	  <Paul.Haldane@newcastle.ac.uk>.  This code is enabled by the
	  standard -DWATCH_OS or individually by
	  -DWATCH_NFS_SERVER.  The define -DWATCH_NFS has been
	  superseded by -DWATCH_NFS_CLIENT, but to keep backwards
	  compatibility, -DWATCH_NFS_CLIENT will be defined if
	  -DWATCH_NFS is defined.

	* Include orcallator.se 1.21, which includes the following
	  changes: Prevent core dumps on extremely long access log
	  lines.

Wed Oct 20 17:39:19 PDT 1999

	* Release Orca 0.25.

Wed Oct 20 17:37:01 PDT 1999

	* Fix that annoying warning from pod2html when orca.html is
	  generated.

	* Include Storable 0.607 but continue to only require 0.603.

	* Add a mention in the POD that sending a HUP to the Orca
	  process forces it to look for new files in the next
	  loop.  This is faster than restarting Orca.

	* Change the behavior of warnings when data requested to be
	  plotted in the configuration file does not exist in the
	  source data files.  Any resulting errors from this, such as
	  cannot compile errors, are only sent when the verbose level
	  is above 1 or when the plot is required.

	* Did some renaming of classes and variables in limited
	  places:
	  Orca::SourceDataFile -> Orca::SourceFile
	  files_key            -> group
	  group                -> subgroup
	  gif                  -> image

	* Orcallator.se 1.20 now mentions my new email address of
	  blair@akamai.com instead of the old one.

	* Move all references to my and Orca's home page from
	  GeoCities (www.geocities.com/~bzking/) to Caltech
	  (www.gps.caltech.edu/~blair/orca/) everywhere.

	* In the default orcallator.cfg, make sure it can find
	  compressed orcallator files in the find_files statement.

	* Make sure all Makefile's can rebuild themselves from their
	  Makefile.in and make sure that the Makefile target is built
	  when all is built.

	* Put in an optimization where Orca would not repeatedly
	  create a new anonymous subroutine to catch warnings when
	  eval's were being performed.

	* Add a new make target, orcallator_run_at_boot, which
	  installs into the proper /etc/*.d/ directories the scripts
	  to start orcallator at boot time and stop orcallator at halt
	  time.  Update the INSTALL file to mention this.

	* Fix an important bug where Orca would crash if column names
	  mentioned in the configuration file did not exist in the
	  source data files.  This fix was in
	  Orca::SourceFile::add_plots.

Tue Oct 19 18:25:12 PDT 1999

	* Make all plots optional by default.  Remove the optional
	  plot keyword and add required, which makes a plot required.

Fri Oct 15 11:25:53 PDT 1999

	* Add a new plot in the default orcallator.cfg, the amount of
	  free physical memory.

	* Shorten the legend names in orcallator.cfg so that the
	  complete line fits in the generated image.  Also make the Y
	  legend names more consistent with each other.

Thu Oct 14 15:52:43 PDT 1999

	* Create a orcallator/S99orcallator file that can be used to
	  start orcallator.se at boot time and stop it at halt time.

Thu Oct 14 14:44:00 PDT 1999

	* Release Orca 0.24.

Thu Oct 14 12:17:29 PDT 1999

	* Back down to RRDtool 1.0.7 with only my filename length
	  patch applied per Tobi.

	* Revamp the INSTALL, NEWS, and other files to get a release
	  out.

	* Up the version number of the included RRDs package to
	  1.000072 since it contains some patches specifically for
	  Orca.

Wed Oct 13 12:40:29 PDT 1999

	* Orcallator.se 1.19 prevents a division by zero in
	  calculating the mean_disk_busy if the number of disks on the
	  system is 0.

	* Move the URL
	  http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/orcallator-docs/ to
	  http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/docs/orcallator.html.

	* In cases where there are a large number of data sources in a
	  single image, then the list of available colors is
	  expired.  Now reuse the colors.

	* Make sure plots are displayed in each subgroup's HTML files
	  in the order they appear in the configuration file.

Tue Oct 12 10:27:44 PDT 1999

	* Update orcallator.cfg to remove the maximum and average disk
	  busy plot and add a plot that displays the run percent for
	  each disk.

	* Orcallator 1.18 now renames disk_runp.c?t?d? to
	  disk_runp_c?t?d?.

Mon Oct 11 14:31:38 PDT 1999

	* Update orcallator.cfg to plot the disk space and inode usage
	  for all locally mounted filesystems.

	* Apply a patch to RRDtool that increases the maximum filename
	  length for generated image files from 255 to 1024.

	* Rename &strip_key_name to &escape_name.

Fri Oct  8 14:23:37 PDT 1999

	* Save even more space in Orca generated HTML and image
	  filenames.  On large directories, up to 10% disk space can
	  be saved alone in filenames according to du.  Also, if
	  generated filenames are longer than 235 characters, then
	  compute a MD5 hash of the name, trim the name down to 210
	  characters, and append the MD5 hash.

	* Orcallator.se 1.17 now skips locally mounted /cdrom
	  filesystems.

	* Increase the number of default known colors to 11.

Wed Oct  6 17:59:05 PDT 1999

	* Orcallator.se 1.16 now compresses its log files after it has
	  completed a day's log using the command in the COMPRESSOR
	  environmental variable.  start_orcallator now passed this
	  environmental variable to orcallator.se.

Wed Oct  6 15:19:09 PDT 1999

	* Have configure.in look for bzip2, bunzip2, gzip, gunzip,
	  compress, and uncompress.  Define the COMPRESSOR and
	  UNCOMPRESSOR_PIPE as the best compression tool to use and
	  add these names to the list of names being substituted.
	  This only gets defined if both a compress and uncompression
	  tool is used.

	* To keep backwards compatibility in orcallator.se, define
	  WATCH_WEB if WATCH_HTTPD is defined.

Tue Oct  5 14:54:59 PDT 1999

	* Update orcallator.se to 1.15.  kvm$mpid is a int not a long.
	  This caused problems on Solaris 7 hosts running a 64 bit
	  kernel.

Fri Oct  1 12:15:47 PDT 1999

	* Update orcallator.se to 1.14.  Rename disk.c?t?d? column
	  names to disk_runp.c?t?d? to better reflect the data being
	  recorded and to allow for more per disk information later.

	* Install the latest RRDtool patch.

Thu Sep 29 19:19:23 PDT 1999

	* Add some more space between a plot's legend and the minimum,
	  maximum, etc information for a particular piece of data.

	* Allow mathematical expressions in plots where the first data
	  contains a regular expression.

Fri Sep 24 11:50:33 PDT 1999

	* Many fixes and improvements to orcallator.se.  Fix a bug in
	  the disk_mean calculation where it was being divided by the
	  wrong disk_count.  Now it should be much larger and in scale
	  with disk_peak.  When WATCH_DISK is defined, now print each
	  disk's run percent.  Add a new define WATCH_MOUNTS, which
	  reports each mount point's disk space and inode capacity,
	  usage, available for non-root users and percent used.  This
	  comes from Duncan Lawie tyger@hoopoes.com.  Add some smarts
	  so that if the number of interfaces, physical disk, or
	  mounted partitions changes, then a new header is printed.
	  This will prevent column name and data mixups when the
	  system configuration changes.

Mon Sep 20 11:18:21 PDT 1999

	* Include Storable 0.605 but continue to only require 0.603.

Tue Sep 14 15:54:38 PDT 1999

	* Add the page scan rate to orcallator.se as column scanrate.

Tue Sep  7 12:21:52 PDT 1999

	* Update the archive URLs for the orca-* mailing lists.

Thu Sep  2 11:03:19 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.7.

	* Make some more minor changes to have Orca run with Perl
	  5.004_01.

Tue Aug 24 11:32:34 PDT 1999

	* Include and require Math::Interpolate 1.05.

Thu Aug 19 14:13:16 PDT 1999

	* No longer include Compress::Zlib, which was to be used to
	  read in compressed source data files without spawning a
	  separate process.  Now it seems easier to just call gunzip
	  -c.

Wed Aug 18 11:10:21 PDT 1999

	* Read in .gz files using gunzip, .Z files using uncompress,
	  and .bz2 files with bunzip2.

	* Clean up some bugs where the RRDs::graph -r option would
	  always be used.

	* Plots can now take a logarithmic option which specified that
	  the Y axis will have a logarithmic scale.

Tue Aug 17 11:50:34 PDT 1999

	* Include and require Math::Interpolate 1.04.

	* No longer have Orca::RRDFile be a subclass of
	  Orca::DataFile, since Orca::DataFile now handles FIDs and
	  the FID namespace should not be polluted by the RRD
	  filenames.

Mon Aug 16 12:11:48 PDT 1999

	* Design a new module, Orca::FileIDs, for managing the long
	  lists of long filenames for memory and CPU speed
	  improvements.  Now all classes use File IDentifiers (FIDs)
	  instead of filenames.

	* Add locking on a particular configuration file.  Make a
	  directory using the configuration filename.

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.6.

Fri Aug 13 17:10:23 PDT 1999

	* Install librrd.so on Solaris hosts in $libdir so that
	  orcallator.se can attach to it.

Fri Aug 13 15:35:21 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.5.

Mon Aug  9 10:32:42 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.4.

Fri Aug  6 09:29:14 PDT 1999

	* Include Digest::MD5 2.09 but continue to only require 2.00.

Thu Aug  5 20:58:32 PDT 1999

	* Make sure start_orcallator looks to see if SE is defined.
	  If it is not, then print a message stating where to find the
	  SE toolkit.

Fri Jul 30 09:12:20 PDT 1999

	* Update orcallator.cfg to plot the new process spawn rate.

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.3.

Thu Jul 29 10:36:20 PDT 1999

	* To fix the problem of too long HTML and image file names,
	  shorten the names as they get passed through
	  strip_key_name.  Now orcallator -> o, orca -> o, _times_ ->
	  _X_, _percent_ -> _pct_, _number_ -> _num_.  The
	  upgrade_installation will perform these renames on a list of
	  directories.

	* Since orcallator is only one of many different data
	  gatherers, move it into its own directory.

Wed Jul 28 10:10:53 PDT 1999

	* If WATCH_CPU is defined and if the user can read /dev/kmem
	  then orcallator.se will now measure the process spawn rate
	  over a 5 minute interval and also record the maximum rate
	  measured over a 5 second interval.

	* Add a href field for a plot in the configuration file.
	  This, if defined, lets you make a particular target type be
	  a HREF to read something about that target type.

	* Include Digest::MD5 2.08 but continue to only require 2.00.

Fri Jul 23 13:41:36 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.1.

Thu Jul 22 17:06:45 PDT 1999

	* Use a blessed reference to an array for the Orca::DataFile,
	  Orca::HTMLFile, Orca::ImageFile, Orca::OpenFileHash,
	  Orca::RRDFile, and Orca::OpenFileHash classes.

Mon Jul 19 12:57:56 PDT 1999

	* On a fresh install make sure to mkdir RRD_DIR/orcallator.

	* Change the tag name data_dir to rrd_dir to make it clearer
	  what kind of data is being loaded.

	* Integrate building of Compress::Zlib into the Makefile
	  structure.  Make use of the Zlib 1.1.3 library included with
	  RRDtool for Compress::Zlib.

Fri Jul 16 11:12:02 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 1.0.0 and Compress::Zlib 1.05.

	* Update the colors in orcallator.cfg.  In all plots, make one
	  plot use area.

Thu Jul 15 11:35:52 PDT 1999

	* As noted by Bob Hoekstra <Bob_Hoekstra@merck.com>,
	  orcallator.se was outputting the same information for ??load
	  as for ??runq.  Orcallator.se no longer generates that data
	  and orcallator.cfg no longer generates plots for it.

Wed Jul 14 11:04:09 PDT 1999

	* Switch to use PNGs instead of GIFs.  They take up 1/3 less
	  space than GIFs and at least 10% less time to generate.

	* Rename all variables and comments containing GIF to image.

	* Revamp the INSTALL document to reflect the new * -> _times_
	  change and add some documentation of the file descriptor
	  limit.

	* Uncompress and read .Z and .gz compressed input files on the
	* fly.

Wed Jul 14 10:22:13 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 0.99.52.

Tue Jul 13 12:34:29 PDT 1999

	Include Storable 0.604 but continue to only require 0.603.

Thu Jul  8 16:22:45 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.50.

Wed Jul  7 13:26:55 PDT 1999

	Rename the migrate_to_orcallator script to upgrade_installation.

	* Per Vadim Shulkin <vadim.shulkin@csfb.com> request, replace
	  the * in all generated filenames with _times_.  Put this
	  rename in the new upgrade_installation script.

Tue Jul  6 18:14:20 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 0.99.49.

Sun Jul  4 16:57:28 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 0.99.47.

Fri Jul  2 18:16:21 PDT 1999

	* Include and require RRDtool 0.99.46.

Tue Jun 29 13:18:57 PDT 1999

	* Add a new option for each plot named base that allows the
	  base for each plot to be either 1000 or 1024.  This allows
	  for plotting of memory or network type of datas.

	* Use the new base option in the number of bytes of available
	  swap space plots.

	* Include and require RRDtool 0.99.45.

	* Make use of RRDtool's 0.99.45 capability to place the SI
	  number suffix to numbers appearing in the legend using the
	  GPRINT command.

Mon Jun 28 11:16:46 PDT 1999

	* Now only print found filenames if the verbose level is above
	  one.  Orca was generating too much output.

	* When creating all the HTML files, do not write directly to
	  the new filename, instead write to a temporary filename and
	  when the file is closed, then rename it to the final name.
	  This lets the user view existing HTML files even when the
	  new HTML files are being updated.

	* Include RRDtool 0.99.41 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

Tue Jun 22 10:54:39 PDT 1999

	* Include RRDtool 0.99.40 but continue to only require
	  0.99.29.

Thu Jun 10 09:39:36 PDT 1999

	* When 80% of a host's processes are web serving processes,
	  plotting the total system and number of httpd's together on
	  the same plot makes sense.  However, for people running a
	  tiny web server with only a few processes, this does not
	  make sense, so a separate plot is created.  Noted by Paul
	  Company <paul.company@plpt.com>.

Tue Jun  8 15:16:43 PDT 1999

	* Begin the break up orca.pl into separate files for each
	  module.

Tue Jun  8 10:57:39 PDT 1999

	* Make the table of contents in INSTALL consistent with the
	  contents of the file.

Mon Jun  7 13:01:05 PDT 1999

	* Include RRDtool 0.99.32 but continue to only require
	  0.99.29.

Thu Jun  3 13:27:09 PDT 1999

	* Fix a bug in Orca::SourceDataFile::add_plots where it was
	  dereferencing an undef.

	* Since orcallator.se may watch many different types of web
	  server logs, move some of the common code into CPP defines.
	  Defines are preferred over functions since the function call
	  overhead in SE is larger than having the code inlined.

	* Have orcallator.se watch Yahoo! style web access logs if
	  -DWATCH_YAHOO is passed on the command line.

	* If any of the environmental variables used by orcallator.se
	  were defined then the value was used, even if the length was
	  zero.  Now the length of the variable must be non-zero for
	  the value to be used, otherwise the default value is used.

Wed Jun  2 12:11:44 PDT 1999

	* Optimize orcallator.se slightly when it determines the size
	  bin for a particular file served.

	* Change the define WATCH_HTTPD in orcallator.se to WATCH_WEB
	  to be consistent with the other WEB_* defines and
	  environmental variables.

Tue Jun  1 21:53:15 PDT 1999

	* For orcallator.se, if the WEB_SERVER environmental variable
	  is set, then the value of WEB_SERVER is used to count the
	  number of web server processes.  If WEB_SERVER is not
	  defined it defaults to httpd.

Fri May 28 17:39:36 PDT 1999

	* Add to the plot title the type of the plot, i.e. 'Yearly',
	  in every GIF.  Requested by Tom Murray
	  <murray@reston.wcom.net>.

Thu May 27 10:53:02 PDT 1999

	* Release version 0.23.

Thu May 27 09:24:20 PDT 1999

	* Add another optimization that saves the result of computing
	  how old each GIF must be before it is recreated.

	* Fix a bug noted by Peter Radcliffe <pir@pir.net> where I
	  missed changing some PERCOLLATOR_DIR variables to
	  ORCALLATOR_DIR in src/start_orcallator.sh.in and
	  src/orcallator_running.pl.in.

Wed May 26 17:54:26 PDT 1999

	* Release version 0.22.

Wed May 26 12:10:42 PDT 1999

	* Move the portions of the code that generate the RRDs::graph
	  options that do not change between invocations to the
	  _update_graph_options method.  This method gets called when
	  the Orca::GIFFile is constructed and any time add_rrds is
	  called.  This speeds Orca up slightly.

	* Include RRDtool 0.99.31 but continue to only require
	  0.99.29.

	* Add a new quarterly plot that shows the last 100 days.  This
	  is a nice transition between the monthly and yearly plots.

	* Change the number of days shown in the yearly plot from 500
	  to 428, which is one year and two months.  Reducing the
	  number of days from 500 by at least one day will speed up
	  the GIF generation time because by default the plot portion
	  of the GIFs are 500 pixels wide.

	* Add two new classes Orca::Config::Plot and
	  Orca::Config::FilesGroup that do not do anything yet but
	  will provide an object-oriented interface to config_plots
	  and config_files.  Currently all the values in
	  @$config_plots and %$config_files are now bless objects
	  instead of unblessed objects.

Thu May 20 10:59:26 PDT 1999

	* Put a closing ) in a error message in RRDtool 0.99.29.1.

	* Fix a bug in queue_data where it was sending data to
	  rrd_update that was already in the RRD file.

Wed May 19 10:43:48 PDT 1999

	* Remove the load_state and save_state subroutines and replace
	  them with an object-oriented Orca::State class for saving
	  information between Orca invocations.  Use the Storable
	  class to save information instead of a text based method.

	* Restructured the code so each Orca::SourceDataFile has only
	  one anonymous subroutine to read in all the valued from a
	  single line of the source data file.  This sped Orca up
	  slightly.

	* Add a -r option to Orca to have it not create any HTML or
	  GIF files and only update the RRD files.

	* Fix a bug where if the number of columns changed in from
	  one source file to the next source file in a files group,
	  the column index used to get a particular value is the old
	  index for the old file and not the new index for the new
	  file.  This fix involved having the Orca::SourceDataFile
	  object run the anonymous subroutines to pick the correct
	  data from a line instead of Orca::RRDFile.

	* Remove some unused methods: Orca::OpenFileHash::list,
	  Orca::OpenFileHash::select,
	  Orca::OpenFileHash::sysread_readline.  Add some more
	  documentation to orcallator.cfg.

	* Skip a line in an input source data file if the word
	  timestamp is found in it.  This is a temporary fix.

Mon May 17 16:26:17 PDT 1999

	* Release version 0.21.

Mon May 17 15:07:33 PDT 1999

	* Correct a bug when a source data file cannot be loaded it
	  should not used to look up a Orca::SourceDataFile object.

	* Reformat all the comments in orca.pl.

Thu May 13 10:47:41 PDT 1999

	* Orca used to delete RRD files if they had an
	  $ORCA_RRD_VERSION number newer then the required version
	  number.  Now use them.  Add code to remember the Orca RRD
	  version number so that the GIF creation code works properly
	  with RRD files with a version different than
	  $ORCA_RRD_VERSION.

	* Thanks to a configure file and some data from Eric Blaise
	  <Eric.Blaise@socgen.com>, Orca can now handle plots
	  containing columns of data that do not exist in all input
	  source data files.

	* In add_plots, a linear search was used to convert column
	  description names appearing in data statements to an index
	  into the column_description array.  Now use a hash table
	  look up.

Wed May 12 09:31:43 PDT 1999

	* Orca now cleans up all file paths in the input configuration
	  file.  If more than one / are found in a row, they are
	  replaced by one /.  The base_dir is only prepended to paths
	  if the path does not match ^\\?\.{0,2}/, which will match on
	  /, ./, ../, and \./.

	* The paths used to find input files are now passed through
	  the following regular expressions: s:^\\./:: and
	  s:/\\./:/:g.  These remove unnecessary searches through the
	  current directory.

	* Perl_glob will only return found files and no other type.
	  It will also not follow any directories named '..'.

	* Include RRDtool 0.99.29.1 with Orca.  This includes a
	  Makefile patch and does not include a new version of RRDs.pm
	  or librrd.

	* In any Makefile.in's that run config.status, they used to
	  run a make from the top level directory.  Now they only run
	  a make from the directory that required the running of
	  config.status.

Tue May 11 16:24:09 PDT 1999

	* In places where deep copies of data structures are made and
	  no s///'s are performed on the text form of data, use dclone
	  that comes with Storable instead of using Data::Dumper and
	  eval.

	* Do not prepend base_dir to any paths if they begin with
	  either '/' or './'.

	* Require and include RRDtool 0.99.29 with Orca.

	* Orca now includes the four Perl packages it depends upon:
	  Digest::MD5 2.07, Math::Interpolate 1.02, RRDtool 0.99.29,
	  and Storable 0.6@3.

Mon May 10 10:46:36 PDT 1999

	* Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.07 and require
	  RRDtool 0.99.28.

Sat May  8 19:29:14 PDT 1999

	* Upgrade the instructions to mention Math::Interpolate 1.02
	  instead of Math::Interpolator 1.01.

Thu May  6 13:58:06 PDT 1999

	* Orca does not normally display the daily, weekly, monthly,
	  yearly, and everything plots for all the different
	  measurements if there is only one group.  However, it is
	  nice to see all the different measurement plots in one page
	  for a single group, so if now there is only one group, then
	  an Everything group placed at the top of the main index.html
	  file for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly overviews.

	* Make a comment about using gd1.3 versus gd1.2 in INSTALL
	  when building RRDtool.  Because RRDtool comes with gd1.2 and
	  generates smaller GIFs, a comment is made that there is no
	  reason to move to gd1.3.  The bottom line is that gd1.2 is
	  preferred.

	* Check if the state file is empty and do not complain if it
	  is.

	* Add installation instructions that to install this version
	  of Orca over an older version, a make migrate command will
	  need to be run to renames all files and directories
	  containing percollator, percol, or perc to orcallator in any
	  of the installed Orca directories.

	* Update orcallator.cfg to look for filenames like
	  orcallator-1999-05-06 and percol-1999-05-06.

Wed May  5 10:43:23 PDT 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.27.

Mon May  3 14:51:06 PDT 1999

	* Rename everything percollator, perc and percol to
	  orcallator.

Fri Apr 30 16:34:20 PDT 1999

	* Update to install Perl 5.005_03 instead of 5.005_02.

Fri Apr 23 09:31:28 PDT 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.25.

Thu Apr 22 09:21:15 PDT 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.24.

Sat Apr 17 12:06:46 PDT 1999

	* Change all URLs from
	    http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Thinktank/4996/
	  to
	    http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/

Thu Apr  8 17:03:37 PDT 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.23.

Wed Mar 31 19:07:41 PST 1999

	* When perl_glob cannot open a directory, return an empty
	  array and warn instead of dying.  Fix from J.R. Tietsort
	  <jrtietsort@micron.com>.

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.22 which contains a memory leak bug
	  fix.

Sat Mar 27 10:07:09 PST 1999

	* Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.06 and require
	  RRDtool 0.99.21.

Thu Mar 25 15:30:00 PST 1999

	* Speed up count_proc() in percollator.se by 20% using a patch
	  supplied by Rich Pettit <rpettit@resolute.com>.

Sat Mar  6 11:50:57 PST 1999

	* Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.04.

Thu Mar  4 16:42:03 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.19.

Mon Mar  1 11:01:01 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.18.

Tue Feb 23 09:19:37 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.15.

	* Die if a unrecognized command line option is given to Orca.

	* Do group name substitution on the Y legend in GIFs.

	* Add another consolidation function, DERIVE, to an error
	  message.

	* Change the user, system and idle colors in the CPU usage
	  plot as requested by Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.

	* Change the printing format of usr% and sys% from %4.0f to
	  %5.1f in percollator.se to work around a printing problem
	  reported by Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.  In SE 3.1
	  this will now display an extra non-zero digit of measured
	  precision.

	* Always output the header information in percollator.se, even
	  if Orca cannot handle it yet, since the number of columns
	  may change if new hardware is added to the system.

Mon Feb 22 10:23:21 PST 1999

	* Add GIF width and height tags to img src's using the
	  returned GIF size from RRDs::graph.

	* Add a space between the ending " for the img src="" and the
	  following alt="" in the generated HTML.

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.14.

	* Add x86 Ethernet device plotting to percollator.cfg.in.

	* Remove the LAST RRA from all Orca created RRAs since it is
	  not required to get the current value from an RRA.  The
	  current value is obtained by using the LAST consolidation
	  function on the plotted data.

Sun Feb 21 11:03:39 PST 1999

	* Make use of RRDtool 0.99.12's legend formatting.

Sat Feb 20 20:13:01 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.12.

Fri Feb 19 11:55:50 PST 1999

	* Move some </a> tags to the end of the image they were
	  referencing to remove some Netscape glitches.

	* Minor spelling fix and addition to CHANGES file.

	* Version 0.20.

	* Have the Orca logo be a hyperlink to the Orca home page.

	* Version 0.19.

	* Fix a bug in copying SE 3.1's percollator.se changes where
	  it was not skipping the HTTP/1.x code in the NCSA style
	  access log.  Now percollator.se can handle log files with or
	  without the code.

Thu Feb 18 11:54:03 PST 1999

	* percollator.se now logs information on integral multiples of
	  the interval.  This is useful for RRD which expects data to
	  be measured on the interval.

	* Fix a bug in percollator.se where it was inflating the
	  httpops5 number since it was not calculating the actual time
	  interval and instead assuming a 5 second interval.

	* Add Squid log processing to percollator.se courtesy of
	  Adrian Cockcroft of Sun Microsystems.

	* Rename the configure --with options.  If you want to watch
	  NCSA style access logs, use --with-ncsa-log.  To watch NCSA
	  style proxy access logs, use --with-proxy-log.  And to watch
	  Squid access log, use --with-squid-log.

Wed Feb 17 17:37:35 PST 1999

	* Add rrdtool.gif to the GIF files that Orca creates and
	  include a HREF to rrdtool.gif in every HTML file that Orca
	  generates.

Tue Feb 16 10:49:07 PST 1999

	* Version 0.18.

	* Minor fixes.

	* Version 0.17.

	* Group names are now sorted depending upon the format of the
	  group names.  For example, this now will list nfs13 after
	  nfs5, even though cmp will sort nfs13 before nfs5.

	* Created GIFs now print the current measured value in
	  addition to the average measured value.

	* percollator.cfg.in updated to shorten the http and inode
	  with page steals legends to have shorter legends so that
	  RRDtool will plot the whole comment along with the average
	  and last value in the GIF.

Mon Feb 15 12:29:18 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.11.

	* Add versioning information to the DS names created by Orca
	  so new versions of Orca can make older RRD files obsolete.
	  This feature is now used to make sure that the current
	  measurement using LAST is stored in Orca's RRDs.

Fri Feb 12 15:10:05 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.10.

	* When creating a brand new RRD, create new RRAs for the
	  current value measured using the LAST DS type.

Thu Feb 11 11:48:14 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.8.

Thu Feb  4 12:51:54 PST 1999

	* Update the installation instructions for SE 3.1 beta.

Fri Jan 29 15:38:53 PST 1999

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.6.

Thu Jan 28 15:44:07 PST 1999

	* If a file uses the first line as a column description and if
	  the following line does not have the same number of columns,
	  then warn and skip that line.

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.4.

Tue Jan 26 15:28:26 PST 1999

	* Rename Orca::GIFFile::expire_string to
	  Orca::GIFFile::_expire_string.

	* Change the default location of the percollator RRDs to be
	  $prefix/var/orca/rrd/percollator instead of
	  $prefix/var/orca/rrd.

	* Sort the order of RRD files being updated by the RRD's
	  filename.

	* Do not make RRD_DIR/percollator

	* Require RRDtool 0.99.2.

	* Remove sanity check on group update times that could cause
	  false dies.

Tue Jan 26 10:07:40 PST 1999

	* Version 0.16.

	* Fix a bug in lib/Makefile.in where the variable $(CP) was
	  used but never defined.

	* Fix a bug where watch_data_sources() would do an extra loop
	  each time file updates were looked for.

Mon Jan 25 15:25:12 PST 1999

	* Version 0.15.

	* Update to use RRDtool 0.99.1.

	* Rename not_running to percol_running.

	* Update the URL to Tobias Oetiker's RRD web site.

	* Make sure lib/Makefile does not overwrite old
	  lib/percollator.cfg's when a make install is done.

Fri Jan 22 20:17:56 PST 1999

	* Create an Orca logo and have the logo appear at the bottom
	  of each HTML file.  The logo is stored as hexadecimal inside
	  the Orca perl script.

	* Update percollator.cfg.in to not contain bzajac@geostaff.com
	  any more.  Changed it to root@localhost.

Thu Jan 21 13:31:50 PST 1999

	* Add a configure script to Orca to make installation of Orca
	  and percollator much easier.

	* Add a new file env_percol to set up all the environmental
	  variables so that percollator runs correctly instead of
	  having to edit start_percol, stop_percol, and
	  restart_percol.

Mon Jan 11 16:58:28 PST 1999

	* Require MRTG version 0.04 minimum.  This corresponds to
	  mrtg-19990111.22.

Wed Jan  6 09:47:44 PST 1999

	* Version 0.14.

	* Change the program's name from FMRTG to Orca.

	* Change all references of SMRTG to Cricket.

Fri Dec 18 13:10:47 PST 1998

	* Change all occurances of MRTG in fmrtg to FMRTG.

Thu Dec 10 16:47:20 PST 1998

	* Add percol_column to the list of programs in the percollator
	  directory.  This program makes it easy to read several
	  columns of data from a percollator.se output file instead of
	  trying to look at 1000 character lines that percollator.se
	  generally outputs.

Thu Dec 10 12:50:19 PST 1998

	* Version 0.13.

	* Found an extra loop in creating the HTML files.  They are
	  now created much faster.

	* Add HREFs to the top of the HTML files showing plots from
	  different groups and different data types to make jumping
	  around easier.

	* Add more documentation to &create_html_files.

	* Add some documentation describing why Digest::MD5 is used.

Wed Dec  9 13:35:07 PST 1998

	* Add more documentation to fmrtg and percollator about
	  setting up FMRTG and percollator.se to work together.

Wed Dec  9 09:55:01 PST 1998

	* Version 0.12.

	* Correct incorrect URL for Digest::MD5 in fmrtg.

Tue Dec  8 12:12:07 PST 1998

	* Version 0.11.

	* Update the sample FMRTG configuration files to work properly
	  with the configuration options in FMRTG.

	* Switch from MD5 to Digest::MD5, since it is faster.

	* Update the documentation to reflect the above changes.

	* Update the code documentation in fmrtg for date_source.

	* Add some more documentation to the percollator/start_percol
	  script.

Fri Dec  4 14:34:13 PST 1998

	* Version 0.10.
