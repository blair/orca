History change for procallator
0.01:	- first version
0.02:	- fixed some stats of disk usage on NFS disks
0.03:   - License changed to GPL
        - Multiple files per day if number of columns of the output changes
        - Added compatibility with 2.6 kernel versions
        - Added support for /proc/partitions -> partitions stats in 2.4 kernels
        - Added support for /proc/diskstats  -> partitions stats in 2.6 kernels
        - Removed support for page-ins e page-ous metrics due to misunderstood
          interpretations real meaning of values
        - New cfg file, with better handling of tcp stats - every stat is now a
          counter and not gauges, this corrects the way the stas are plotted, 
          sadly its not compatible with older versions
        - Added IO Wait for 2.6 kernels
        - Using real device names on disk statistics for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
        - Added NFS4 statistics, and revised NFS config (now totalizes every NFS
	  version by default)
        - Added configuration variable to control some network protocol
          colection
        - Process now starts as a real daemon
        - Now it is integrated with orca install and makefiles
        - Used perltidy to embelish and uniformize perl source code
        IMPORTANT - Due to the various fixes and additions the new config file
        as well as the new collected files are not compatible with older 
        versions, that way, using the new cfg with older collected data, or 
        the older cfg with newer collected data may lead to some problems, like
        missing graphs and so. That way the upgrade should be planned with care
0.04	- Added support for COMPRESS variable in configure scripts, defaults to
        /usr/bin/gzip
        - Fixed error on .cfg regarding the NFS statsdata types, were COUNTERs
        when they should be modelled as GAUGEs
