CPU Utilization doesn't break out on a multiprocessor system.
In fact, no explaination on how it works on such a platform.
I guess I'll look at the source.
I'm assuming it aggregates all processors.

--pjc

And none of the give a small paragraph description
of the 33 Data Sets.

As I mentioned before, most of these are self explainitory,
but some need more explaination. For example,
        how large is a packet &/or segment (I know they're variable length),
        what is a Nocanput Rate,
        what is the unit, the y-axis (Disk Busy Measure) on Peak & Mean Disk
Busy
        ...
        I'm looking them up in Adrian's book, but it would be nice if they
were
        included in the documentation for orcallator.

Hello Paul,

True on the first observation, not always true on the bits per second
depending on the OS version and the support for the different
Ethernet port types.  On 2.6 or greater, I believe all hme, le, etc
measure bits per second, but on older OSes, you cannot get these
on all Ethernet types.

What do you mean by "No definitions for Data Sets"?  Is this missing
from the Orca manual?

Thanks for the notes, I'll put them in the next release of Orca.
