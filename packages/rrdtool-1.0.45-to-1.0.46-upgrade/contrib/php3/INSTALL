Installation:

  You'll want to have the following sources available somewhere:
        php
        rrdtool
        apache (if you built php as a DSO)

  Edit the *INCLUDE and *LIB variables in the Makefile to indicate
the correct locations for your files.

  After php3_rrdtool.so builds correctly, copy this file to wherever
you'd like.  Possibly APACHE_ROOT/libexec/ .



After you install, you should probably read README and API.
