Time::HiRes module: High resolution time, sleep, and alarm.

Implement usleep, ualarm, and gettimeofday for Perl, as well as wrappers
to implement time, sleep, and alarm that know about non-integral seconds.

1.31 and 1.32 add more backward compatibility (now all the way back to
Perl 5.00404), and using nanosleep() (if available) for subsecond sleeps.

1.30 adds all the changes made during the Perl 5.6->5.7->5.8 development
cycle.  Most notably portability across platforms has been enhanced,
and the interval timers (setitimer, getitimer) have been added.
Note that the version of Time::HiRes that is included in Perl 5.8.0
calls itself 1.20_00, but it is equivalent to this Time::HiRes version.
Note also that in 1.30 Wegscheid turns over the maintenance to Jarkko
Hietaniemi.

1.20 adds a platform neutral set of C accessible routines if you are running
5.005+.  All other changes are packaging changes and build fixes(?) for
statically linked Perl, SCO, and VMS.

1.19 has better VMS support.

1.18 has limited Win32 support (no ualarm). Added usleep for Win32.
Probably buggy. I'm sure I'll hear.

1.16+ should be closer to building out of the box on Linux. Thanks
to Gisle Aas for patches, and the ualarm equivalent using setitimer.

If your underlying operating system doesn't implement ualarm(), then a fake
using setitimer() will be made.  If the OS is missing usleep(), a fake one
using select() will be made. If a fake can't be made for either ualarm() or
usleep(), then the corresponding Perl function will not be available.  If the
OS is missing gettimeofday(), you will get unresolved externals, either at
link- or run-time.

This is an improvement; the package used to not even build if you were
missing any of these bits. Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org> did all 
the conditional compilation stuff, look at HiRes.pm and the test suites; 
it's good educational reading.

Note: the tests of this module are by definition time sensitive: under
heavy loads the tests may fail.  Reasonable relaxed criteria are being
used for the tests but sometimes you may still see transient failures.
Rerun the tests (make test) a couple of times, preferably with less
load on the testing machine.

Also, older versions of Perl do not support '-nolinenumbers' on the XSUBPP
command, however, 5.004_03 requires it (on my box, anyway) since the #line
generating code in XSUBPP appears to have problems with #ifdef'd .xs code. If
xsubpp complains about usage when you do a make, look at the top of the
Makefile.PL and comment out the "$XSOPT=" line. Or upgrade to a newer version
of Perl.
