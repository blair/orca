Procallator TODO list:
- Use the same names for data sets as in the Solaris version to use the same 
  config files -- that seems harder each version -> too many different metrics
- Document and optimize collector source code. It is possible to do lots of 
  optimizations and better memory handling
- Write better config file for network and NFS stats
- Add web server stats
- LVM statistics
- Document metric meanings and best tuning practices
