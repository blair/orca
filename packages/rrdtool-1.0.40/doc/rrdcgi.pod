rrdcgi - create web pages containing RRD graphs based on templates

=for html <div align="right"><a href="rrdcgi.pdf">PDF</a> version.</div>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#!/path/to/B<rrdcgi> 
S<[B<--filter>]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rrdcgi> is a sort of very limited script interpreter. Its purpose
is to run as a cgi-program and parse a web page template containing special
E<lt>RRD:: tags. B<rrdcgi> will interpret and act according to these tags.
In the end it will printout a web page including the necessary CGI headers.

B<rrdcgi> parses the contents of the template in 2 steps. In each step it looks
only for a subset of tags. This allows to nest tags. 

The argument parser uses the same semantics as you are used from your c shell.

=item RRD::CV I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name.

=item RRD::CV::QUOTE I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name but quotes it, ready for
use as an argument in another RRD:: tag. So even when there are spaces in the
value of the CGI variable it will still be considered as one argument.

=item RRD::CV::PATH I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name, quotes it and makes sure
the it starts neither with a '/' nor contains '..'. This is to make
sure that no problematic pathnames can be introduced through the 
CGI interface.

=item RRD::GETENV I<variable>

Get the value of an environment variable.

 <RRD::GETENV REMOTE_USER>

might give you the name of the remote user given you are using
some sort of access control on the directory

=head2 Pass 2

=over 8

=item RRD::GOODFOR I<seconds>

Specify the number of seconds this page should remain valid. This will prompt
the rrdcgi to output a Last-Modified, an Expire and if the number of
seconds is I<negative> a Refresh headers.

=item RRD::INCLUDE I<filename>

Include the contents of the given file into the page returned from the cgi

=item RRD::SETENV I<variable> I<value>

If you want to present your graphs in another time zone than your own, you
could use

 <RRD::SETENV TZ UTC>

to make sure everything is presented in Universal Time. Note that the
values permitted to TZ depend on your OS.

=item RRD::TIME::LAST I<rrd-file> I<strftime-format>

This gets replaced by the last modification time of the selected RRD. The
time is I<strftime>-formated with the string specified in the second argument.

=item RRD::TIME::NOW I<strftime-format>

This gets replaced by the current time of day. The
time is I<strftime>-formated with the string specified in the argument.

=item RRD::GRAPH I<rrdgraph arguments>

This tag creates the RRD graph defined in its argument and then gets
replaced by an appropriate E<lt>IMGE<gt> tag referring to the graph.
The B<--lazy> option in RRD graph can be used to make sure that graphs
are only regenerated when they are out of date. The arguments
to the B<RRD::GRAPH> tag work as described in the B<rrdgraph> manual page.

Use the B<--lazy> option in your RRD::GRAPH tags, to reduce the load
on your server. This option makes sure that graphs are only regenerated when
the old ones are out of date.

If you do not specify your own B<--imginfo> format, the following will
be used:

 <IMG SRC="%s" WIDTH="%lu" HEIGHT="%lu">

Note that %s stands for the filename part of the graph generated, all
directories given in the GIF file argument will get dropped.

=item RRD::PRINT I<number>

If the preceding  B<RRD::GRAPH> tag contained and B<PRINT> arguments,
then you can access their output with this tag. The I<number> argument refers to the
number of the B<PRINT> argument. This first B<PRINT> has I<number> 0.

=head1 EXAMPLE 1

The example below creates a web pages with a single RRD graph.

 #!/usr/local/bin/rrdcgi
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <H1>RRDCGI Example Page</H1>
 <P>
 <RRD::GRAPH demo.gif --lazy --title="Temperatures"
          DEF:cel=demo.rrd:exhaust:AVERAGE
          LINE2:cel#00a000:"D. Celsius">

 </P>
 </BODY>
 </HTML>

=head1 EXAMPLE 2

This script is slightly more elaborate, it allows you to run it from 
a form which sets RRD_NAME. RRD_NAME is then used to select which RRD
you want to use a source for your graph.

 #!/usr/local/bin/rrdcgi
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <H1>RRDCGI Example Page for <RRD::CV RRD_NAME></H1>
 <H2>Selection</H2>
 <FORM><INPUT NAME=RRD_NAME TYPE=RADIO VALUE=roomA> Room A,
       <INPUT NAME=RRD_NAME TYPE=RADIO VALUE=roomB> Room B.
       <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT></FORM>
 <H2>Graph</H2>
 <P>
 <RRD::GRAPH <RRD::CV::PATH RRD_NAME>.gif --lazy 
          --title "Temperatures for "<RRD::CV::QUOTE RRD_NAME>
          DEF:cel=<RRD::CV::PATH RRD_NAME>.rrd:exhaust:AVERAGE
          LINE2:cel#00a000:"D. Celsius">

 </P>
 </BODY>
 </HTML>

=head1 EXAMPLE 3

This example shows how to handle the case where the RRD, graphs and
cgi-bins are seperate directories

 #!/.../bin/rrdcgi
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <H1>RRDCGI test Page</H1>
 <RRD::GRAPH
  /.../web/gifs/testhvt.gif
  --imginfo '<IMG SRC=/.../gifs/%s WIDTH=%lu HEIGHT=%lu >'
  --lazy --start -1d --end now
  DEF:http_src=/.../rrds/test.rrd:http_src:AVERAGE
  AREA:http_src#00ff00:http_src
 >
 </BODY>
 </HTML>

Note 1: Replace /.../ with the relevant directories

Note 2: The SRC=/.../gifs should be paths from the view of the
webserver/browser
