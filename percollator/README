This directory contains several files for getting percollator.se running
on your system.

To install percollator.se, you need to perform the following steps:

1) Perform the installation instructions as listed on the web page
   http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/performance/se3/

2) Apply the patch file p_netstat_class.se.diff to the
   /opt/RICHPse/include/p_netstat_class.se file using the following
   command

      cd /opt/RICHPse
      patch -s < THIS_DIR/p_netstat_class.se.diff

3) Choose the base directory that will contain the percollator data files.

4) Update the start_percol, stop_percol, and restart_percol files
   set the correct value for the following variables:

   STATSDIR	The base directory for these scripts and data files.
   NCSAHTTPLOG	The location of the web server access_log file.
   AWK		The location of the best awk you have, ie gawk, nawk.

   The start_percol will create a directory STATSDIR/stats_percollator
   where the output data files will be listed.  If you want to change this,
   edit start_percol.

5) Run the start_percol script on each system as root.  It should create
   the needed directories under STATSDIR/stats_percollator.

6) Update the fmrtg/sample_configs/percollator.cfg file to look in the
   new STATSDIR/stats_percollator directory.
