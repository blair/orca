	Cockroft of Sun Microsystems.

	Rename the configure --with options.  If you want to watch NCSA
	style access logs, use --with-ncsa-log.  To watch NCSA style
	proxy access logs, use --with-proxy-log.  And to watch Squid

	Created GIFs now print the current measured value in addition
	to the average measured value.

	percollator.cfg.in updated to shorten the http and inode with
	page steals legends to have shorter legends so that RRDtool will
	plot the whole comment along with the average and last value in
	the GIF.

Mon Feb 15 12:29:18 PST 1999
