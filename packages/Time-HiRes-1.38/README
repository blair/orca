Time::HiRes module: High resolution time, sleep, and alarm.

Implement usleep, ualarm, and gettimeofday for Perl, as well as wrappers
to implement time, sleep, and alarm that know about non-integral seconds.

1.20 adds a platform neutral set of C accessible routines if you are running
5.005+.  All other changes are packaging changes and build fixes(?) for
statically linked Perl, SCO, and VMS.

1.19 has better VMS support.

1.18 has limited Win32 support (no ualarm). Added usleep for Win32.
Probably buggy. I'm sure I'll hear.

1.16+ should be closer to building out of the box on Linux. Thanks
to Gisle Aas for patches, and the ualarm equivalent using setitimer.

If your underlying operating system doesn't implement ualarm(), then a fake
using setitimer() will be made.  If the OS is missing usleep(), a fake one
using select() will be made. If a fake can't be made for either ualarm() or
usleep(), then the corresponding Perl function will not be available.  If the
OS is missing gettimeofday(), you will get unresolved externals, either at
link- or run-time.

This is an improvement; the package used to not even build if you were
missing any of these bits. Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org> did all 
the conditional compilation stuff, look at HiRes.pm and the test suites; 
it's good educational reading.

Also, older versions of Perl do not support '-nolinenumbers' on the XSUBPP
command, however, 5.004_03 requires it (on my box, anyway) since the #line
generating code in XSUBPP appears to have problems with #ifdef'd .xs code. If
xsubpp complains about usage when you do a make, look at the top of the
Makefile.PL and comment out the "$XSOPT=" line. Or upgrade to a newer version
of Perl.
