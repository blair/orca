It is pretty easy to gather status information from all sorts of things,
ranging from the temperature in your office to the number of octets which
have passed through the FDDI interface of your router. But it is not so
trivial to store this data in a efficient and systematic manner. This is
where <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> kicks in. It lets you
<EM>log and analyze</EM> the data you gather from all kinds of data-sources (<STRONG>DS</STRONG>). The data analysis part of rrdtool is based on the ability to quickly
generate graphical representations of the data values collected over a
definable time period.


<P>

In this man page you will find general information on the design and
functionality of the Round Robin Database Tool (rrdtool). For a more
detailed description of how to use the individual functions of the
<STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> check the corresponding man page.

While the man pages talk of command line switches you have to set in order
to make <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> work it is important to note that the <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> can be 'remote controlled' through a set of pipes. This saves a
considerable amount of startup time when you plan to make <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> do a lot of things quickly. Check the section on <A HREF="#Remote_Control">Remote Control</A> further down.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Data">Data acquisition

</A></STRONG><DD>
When monitoring the state of a system, it is convenient to have the data
available at a constant interval. Unfortunately you may not always be able
to fetch data at exactly the time you want to. Therefore <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> lets you update the logfile at any time you want. It will automatically
interpolate the value of the data-source (<STRONG>DS</STRONG>) at the latest official time-slot and write this value to the log. The
value you have supplied is stored as well and is also taken into account
when interpolating the next log entry.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Consolidation">Consolidation

</A></STRONG><DD>
You may log data at a 1 minute interval, but you are also be interested to
know the development of the data over the last year. You could do this by
simply storing the data in 1 minute interval, for one year. While this
would take considerable disk space it would also take a lot of time to
analyze the data when you wanted to create a graph covering the whole year. <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> offers a solution to this of this problem through its data consolidation
feature. When setting up an Round Robin Database (<STRONG>RRD</STRONG>), you can define at which interval this consolidation should occur, and
what consolidation function (<STRONG>CF</STRONG>) (average, minimum, maximum, total, last) should be used to build the
consolidated values (see rrdcreate). You can define any number of different
consolidation setups within one <STRONG>RRD</STRONG>. They will all be maintained on the fly when new data is loaded into the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Round">Round Robin Archives

</A></STRONG><DD>
Data values of the same consolidation setup are stored into Round Robin
Archives (<STRONG>RRA</STRONG>). This is a very efficient manner to store data for a certain amount of
time, while using a known amount of storage space. 


<P>

It works like this: If you want to store 1000 values in 5 minute interval, <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> will allocate space for 1000 data values and a header area. In the header
it will store a pointer telling which one of the values in the storage area
was last written to. New values are written to the Round Robin Archive in a
... you guess it ... round robin manner. This automatically limits the
history to the last 1000 values. Because you can define several <STRONG>RRA</STRONG>s within a single <STRONG>RRD</STRONG>, you can setup another one, storing 750 data values at a 2 hour interval
and thus keeping a log for the last two months although at a lower
resolution.


<P>

The use of <STRONG>RRA</STRONG>s guarantees that the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG> does not grow over time and that old data is automatically eliminated. By
using the consolidation feature, you can still keep data for a very long
time, while gradually reducing the resolution of the data along the time
axis. Using different consolidation functions (<STRONG>CF</STRONG>) allows you to store exactly the type of information that actually
interests you. (Maximum one minute traffic on the LAN, minimum temperature
of the wine cellar, total minutes down time ...)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Unknown">Unknown Data

</A></STRONG><DD>
As mentioned earlier, the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG> stores data at a constant interval. Now it may happen that no new data is
available when a value has to be written to the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG>. Data acquisition may not be possible for one reason or an other. The <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> handles these situations by storing an <EM>*UNKNOWN*</EM> value into the database. The value '<EM>*UNKNOWN*</EM>' is supported through all the functions of the database. When
consolidating the amount of <EM>*UNKNOWN*</EM> data is accumulated and when a new consolidated value is ready to be
written to its Round Robin Archive (<STRONG>RRA</STRONG>) a validity check is performed to make sure that the percentage of unknown
data in the new value is below a configurable level. If so, an <EM>*UNKNOWN*</EM> value will be written to the <STRONG>RRA</STRONG>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Graphing">Graphing

</A></STRONG><DD>
The <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> also allows one to generate reports in numerical and graphical form based
on the data stored in one or several
<STRONG>RRD</STRONG>s. The graphing feature is fully configurable. Size, color and contents of
the graph can be defined freely. Check rrdgraph for more information on
this.

When you start <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> with the command line option '<STRONG>-</STRONG>', it waits for input via standard in. With this feature you can improve
performance by attaching <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> to another process (mrtg is one example) through a set of pipes. Over the
pipes <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG> accepts the same arguments as on the command line. When a command is
completed, rrdtool will print the string '<CODE>OK</CODE>', followed by timing information of the form <STRONG>u:</STRONG><EM>usertime</EM>  <STRONG>s:</STRONG><EM>systemtime</EM> both values are running totals of seconds since rrdtool was started. If an
error occurs, a line of the form '<CODE>ERROR:</CODE>  <EM>Description of error</EM>' will be printed. <STRONG>rrdtool</STRONG>
will not abort if possible, but follow the ERROR line with an OK line.
