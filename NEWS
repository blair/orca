New in version 0.21.
 1) Every file containing the words percollator, percol and perc has
    been renamed to contain the word orcallator.  A new make target named
    migrate will change all filenames in an installed Orca directory to
    the new names.  This `make migrate' should only be run after killing
    any running percollator.se's and Orca processes and before installing
    this version of Orca.
 2) Orca now includes Digest::MD5 2.07, Math::Interpolate 1.02, RRDs
    0.99029, and Storable 0.603 in packages/ to make installation easier.
    The configure script now determines if you have the requisite version
    of these packages installed in your Perl and will modify the Makefiles
    to build the necessary modules.
 3) Orca now displays the daily, weekly, monthly, yearly plots of all
    measurements even if there is only one group.  Orca used to not make
    the web pages showing the different measurements all on one page if
    there was only one group.
 4) Add GIF width and height tags to img src's using the returned GIF
    size from RRDs::graph to speed with page rendering.
 5) Some minor HTML fixes to have the pages look cleaner for Netscape
    browsers.
 6) Make use of RRDtool 0.99.12's legend formatting to clean up the GIF
    legends and to store the minimum and maximum values of a data stream.
 7) Remove the LAST RRA from all Orca created RRAs since it is not
    required to get the current value from an RRA.  This requires
    rebuilding all RRDs.
 8) Add x86 Ethernet device (elxl*) plotting to orcallator.cfg.in.
 9) Do group name substitution on the Y legend in GIFs.
10) Orca used to delete RRD files even if they are created with new
    versions or Orca.  Now the RRD file is used if it is at least as
    new as the version a particular version of Orca needs.
11) Orca now dies if an unrecognized command line option is given.
12) Speed up the count_proc() routine in orcallator.se by 20%.
13) Perl_glob does not die if it cannot open a directory.  It will
    also not follow directories named .. if they happen to match
    a regular expression.  It also only returns files matching the
    regular expressions.
14) Change all references from
    http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Thinktank/4996/
    to
    http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/
15) Speed up Orca by using Storable to do deep clones of objects
    instead of using Data::Dumper and eval.
16) Replace some linear search by a hash lookup to speed up Orca.
17) Fix some bugs in orcallator.se.
18) Clean up some error messages.
