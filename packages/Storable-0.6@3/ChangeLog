. Description:

	Updated benchmark figures due to recent optimizations done in
	store(): tagnums are now stored as-is in the hash table, so
	no surrounding SV is created. And the "shared keys" mode for
	hash table was turned off.

	Fixed backward compatibility (wrt 0.5@9) for retrieval of
	blessed refs. That old version did something wrong, but the
	bugfix prevented correct retrieval of the old format.

. Description:

	Changed benchmark figures.

	Adjust refcnt of tied objects after calling sv_magic() to avoid
	memory leaks.  Contributed by Jeff Gresham.

. Description:

	Added workaround for persistent LVALUE-ness in perl5.004. All
	scalars tagged as being an lvalue are handled as if they were
	not an lvalue at all.  Added test for that LVALUE bug workaround.

	Now handles Perl immortal scalars explicitely, by storing &sv_yes
	as such, explicitely.

	Retrieval of non-immortal undef cannot be shared. Previous
	version was over-optimizing by not creating a separate SV for
	all undefined scalars seen.

. Description:

	Baseline for Storable-0.6@0.

	This version introduces a binary incompatibility in the generated
	binary image, which is more compact than older ones by approximatively
	15%, depending on the exact degree of sharing in your structures.

	The good news is that your older images can still be retrieved with
	this version, i.e. backward compatibility is preserved. This version
	of Storable can only generate new binaries however.

	Another good news is that the retrieval of data structure is
	significantly quicker than before, because a Perl array is used
	instead of a hash table to keep track of retrieved objects, and
	also because the image being smaller, less I/O function calls are
	made.

. Description:

	Version number now got from Storable.pm directly.

	Fixed overzealous sv_type() optimization, which would make
	Storable fail when faced with an "upgraded" SV to the PVIV
	or PVNV kind containing a reference.

. Description:

	Extended the SYNOPSIS section to give quick overview of the
	routines and their signature.

	Optimized sv_type() to avoid flags checking when not needed, i.e.
	when their type makes it impossible for them to be refs or tied.
	This slightly increases throughput by a few percents when refs
	and tied variables are marginal occurrences in your data.

	Stubs for XS now use OutputStream and InputStream file types to
	make it work when the given file is actually a socket. Perl
	makes a distinction for sockets in its internal I/O structures
	by having both a read and a write structure, whereas plain files
	share the same one.

. Description:

	Thanks to a contribution from Benjamin A. Holzman, Storable is now
	able to correctly serialize tied SVs, i.e. tied arrays, hashes
	and scalars.

. Description:

	I said SvPOK() had changed to SvPOKp(), but that was a lie...

Wed Apr  8 13:14:29 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Wrote sizeof(SV *) instead of sizeof(I32) when portable, which
	in effect mangled the object tags and prevented portability
	accross 32/64 bit architectures!

Wed Mar 25 14:57:02 MET 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Added code example for store_fd() and retrieve_fd() in the
	man page, to emphasize that file descriptors must be passed as
	globs, not as plain strings.

	Cannot use SV addresses as tag when using nstore() on LP64. This
	was the cause of problems when creating a storable image on an
	LP64 machine and retrieving it on an ILP32 system, which is
	exactly what nstore() is meant for...

	However, we continue to use SV addresses as tags for plain store(),
	because benchamarking shows that it saves up to 8% of the store
	time, and store() is meant to be fast at the expense of lack
	of portability.

	This means there will be approximately an 8% degradation of
	performance for nstore(), but it's now working as expected.
	That cost may vary on your machine of course, since it is
	solely caused by the memory allocation overhead used to create
	unique SV tags for each distinct stored SV.

. Description:

	Don't use any '_' in version number.

Tue Jan 13 17:51:50 MET 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number.

	added binmode() calls for systems where it matters.

	Be sure to pass globs, not plain file strings, to C routines,
	so that Storable can be used under the Perl debugger.

Wed Nov  5 10:53:22 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Fix memory leaks on seen hash table and returned SV refs.

	Storable did not work properly when tainting enabled.

	Fixed "Allocation too large" messages in freeze/thaw and added.
	proper regression test in t/freeze.t.

Tue Jun  3 09:41:33 METDST 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Added freeze/thaw interface and dclone.

Fri May 16 10:45:47 METDST 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Forgot that AutoLoader does not export its own AUTOLOAD.
	I could use

		use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';
	
	but that would not be backward compatible. So the export is
	done by hand...

Tue Mar 25 11:21:32 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Empty scalar strings are now "defined" at retrieval time.

	New test to ensure an empty string is defined when retrieved.

Thu Feb 27 16:32:44 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Declare VERSION as being used

	Fixed a typo in the PerlIO_putc remapping.
	PerlIO_read and perlIO_write inverted size/nb_items.
	(only relevant for pre-perl5.004 versions)

Thu Feb 27 15:58:31 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Added VERSION identification

	Allow build with perl5.003, which is ante perlIO time

. Description:

	Random code fixes.

Wed Jan 22 15:19:56 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number in Makefile.PL.

	Added "thanks to" section to README.

	Documented new forgive_me variable.

	Made 64-bit clean.

	containing non-storable items like CODE refs.
