This icon can be used, for instance, by apache httpd.

(note: path names may differ in your setup)

Copy the icon to /home/apache/icons/
Modify /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf by adding:

       AddIcon /icons/rrd.png .rrd
       AddDescription "Round Robin Database" .rrd

You could even run a script when an rrd file is clicked on:

       AddHandler rrd-handler rrd
       Action rrd-handler /cgi-bin/some-general-rrd-script.cgi
