Round Robin Database Tools
==========================

It is pretty easy to gather status information from all sorts of things,
ranging from the temperature in your office to the number of octets which
have passed through the FDDI interface of your router. But it is not so
trivial to store this data in a efficient and systematic manner. This is
where rrdtool kicks in. It lets you log and analyze the data you gather from
all kinds of data- sources (DS). The data analysis part of rrdtool is based
on the ability to quickly generate graphical representations of the data
values collected over a definable time period.


To compile:
-----------

		sh configure
		make

	(Please report configure/compilation problems to
	 the developers list, so I can make it better. -jra)
	
	Please note that you should get perl-5.004 for things to work

	Win32 users:
	------------

	Win32 things are controlled by the #define WIN32.
	If your compiler doesn't define that, you should add it to
	the compile line.	-jeff (jeff.allen@acm.org)


Perl bindings:
--------------
The package contains two sets of Perl bindings.

a) perl-piped which uses teh rrdtool through a set of pipes
b) perl-shared which builds a shared library from rrdtool

Both bindings get built by the toplevel make. Additionally
you might want to:

make test
make install

There is an example script in each of the directories. The example
scrips work even when you don't intall the perl extensions.

To learn:
---------

Read the documentation in the doc directory. Start of with
rrdtool. All documents are available as html and as ascii text.  

If you want to know about the format of the logfiles check
src/rrd_format.h there are a lot of comments in there ...

To Contribute:
--------------

send complete patches. A complete patch patches the CODE as well
as the CHANGES, CONTRIBUTORS and the POD files.
