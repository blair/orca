The two scripts included in here are for taking an existing RRD,
dumping out its XML contents, mucking with the XML to add an
arbitrary number of datasources, and then creating a new RRD with
the new XML information. 'add_ds.pl' is what is doing all the
work.  'batch.pl' does the legwork of running rrdtool and 
moving around the output from the various commands.

Easiest way to use these:
* Put batch.pl and add_ds.pl in the same directory as the RRDs
you want to modify and run:

    $ ls -1 | ./batch.pl <# new datasources you want to add>

You'll end up with an 'xml' directory where all the xml files
and your new RRDs are available.  Copy the new RRDs back over
the old RRDs once you've convinced yourself that the new RRDs
have been formed correctly (try using the rrd-dump tool that is
in the cricket/utils directory, for example).

I put some options that you can configure at the top of the
batch.pl script.  Also, add_ds.pl has a bunch of stuff you can
modify at the command line or, again, change inside the script
itself - warning: it's not fancy.  Try: ./add_ds.pl -h

batch.pl has an 'overwrite' option that can be invoked, but I
highly recommend that you check that this script does what you want,
the way you want it, before you go and trample all over your 
existing RRDs.
