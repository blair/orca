Tue Aug 28 23:53:20 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Fixed truncation race with lock_retrieve() in lock_store().
	The file has to be truncated only once the exclusive lock is held.

	Removed spurious debugging messages in .xs file.

Sun Jul  1 13:27:32 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Systematically use "=over 4" for POD linters.
	Apparently, POD linters are much stricter than would
	otherwise be needed, but that's OK.

	Fixed memory corruption on croaks during thaw().  Thanks
	to Claudio Garcia for reproducing this bug and providing the
	code to exercise it.  Added test cases for this bug, adapted
	from Claudio's code.

	Made code compile cleanly with -Wall (from Jarkko Hietaniemi).

	Changed tagnum and classnum from I32 to IV in context.  Also
	from Jarkko.

Thu Mar 15 01:22:32 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Last version was wrongly compiling with assertions on, due
	to an edit glitch.  That did not cause any problem (apart from
	a slight performance loss) excepted on Win* platforms, where the
	assertion code does not compile.

Sat Feb 17 13:37:37 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.10.

	Forgot to increase version number at previous patch (there were
	two of them, which is why we jump from 1.0.8 to 1.0.10).

Sat Feb 17 13:35:00 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.8, binary format 2.4.

	Fixed incorrect error message.

	Now bless objects ASAP at retrieve time, which is meant to fix
	two bugs:

	* Indirect references to overloaded object were not able to
	  restore overloading if the object was not blessed yet,
	  which was possible since blessing occurred only after the
	  recursive retrieval.

	* Storable hooks asking for serialization of blessed ref could
	  get un-blessed refs at retrieval time, for the very same
	  reason.

	The fix implemented here was suggested by Nick Ing-Simmons.

	Added support for blessed ref to tied structures.  This is the
	cause for the binary format change.

	Added EBCDIC version of the compatibility test with 0.6.11,
	from Peter Prymmer

	Added tests for the new features, and to make sure the bugs they
	are meant to fix are indeed fixed.

Wed Jan  3 10:43:18 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Removed spurious 'clean' entry in Makefile.PL.

	Added CAN_FLOCK to determine whether we can flock() or not,
	by inspecting Perl's configuration parameters, as determined
	by Configure.

	Trace offending package when overloading cannot be restored
	on a scalar.

	Made context cleanup safer to avoid dup freeing, mostly in the
	presence of repeated exceptions during store/retrieve (which can
	cause memory leaks anyway, so it's just additional safety, not a
	definite fix).

Sun Nov  5 18:23:48 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.6.

	Fixed severe "object lost" bug for STORABLE_freeze returns,
	when refs to lexicals, taken within the hook, were to be
	serialized by Storable.  Enhanced the t/recurse.t test to
	stress hook a little more with refs to lexicals.

Thu Oct 26 19:14:38 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.5.

	Documented that store() and retrieve() can return undef.
	That is, the error reporting is not always made via exceptions,
	as the paragraph on error reporting was implying.

	Auto requires module of blessed ref when STORABLE_thaw misses.
	When the Storable engine looks for the STORABLE_thaw hook and
	does not find it, it now tries to require the package into which
	the blessed reference is.

	Just check $^O, in t/lock.t: there's no need to pull the whole
	Config module for that.

Mon Oct 23 20:03:49 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.4.

	Protected calls to flock() for DOS platform: apparently, the
	flock/fcnlt emulation is reported to be broken on that
	platform.

	Added logcarp emulation if they don't have Log::Agent, since
	we now use it to carp when lock_store/lock_retrieve is used
	on DOS.

Fri Sep 29 21:52:29 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.3.

	Avoid using "tainted" and "dirty" since Perl remaps them via
	cpp (i.e. #define).  This is deeply harmful when threading
	is enabled.  This concerned both the context structure and
	local variable and argument names.  Brrr..., scary!

Thu Sep 28 23:46:39 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.2.

	Fixed spelling in README.

	Added lock_store, lock_nstore, and lock_retrieve (advisory locking)
	after a proposal from Erik Haugan <erik@solbors.no>.

	Perls before 5.004_04 lack newSVpvn, added remapping in XS.

	Fixed stupid typo in the t/utf8.t test.

Sun Sep 17 18:51:10 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 1.0.1, binary format 2.3.

	Documented that doubles are stored stringified by nstore().

	Added Salvador Ortiz Garcia in CREDITS section,  He identified
	a bug in the store hooks and proposed the right fix: the class
	id was allocated too soon.  His bug case was also added to
	the regression test suite.

	Now only taint retrieved data when source was tainted.  A bug
	discovered by Marc Lehmann.

	Added support for UTF-8 strings, a contribution of Marc Lehmann.
	This is normally only activated in post-5.6 perls.

Thu Aug 31 23:06:06 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

	First official release Storable 1.0, for inclusion in perl 5.7.0.
	The license scheme is now compatible with Perl's.

Thu Aug 24 01:02:02 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:


	ANSI-fied most of the code, preparing for Perl core integration.
	The next version of Storable will be 0.8, and will be integrated
	into the Perl core (development branch).

	Dispatch tables were moved upfront to relieve some compilers,
	especially on AIX and Windows platforms.

	Merged 64-bit fixes from perl5-porters.

Mon Aug 14 09:22:04 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added a refcnt dec in retrieve_tied_key(): sv_magic() increases
	the refcnt on the mg_ptr as well.

	Removed spurious dependency to Devel::Peek, which was used for
	testing only in t/tied_items.t.  Thanks to Conrad Heiney
	<conrad@fringehead.org> for spotting it first.

Sun Aug 13 22:12:59 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Marc Lehmann kindly contributed code to add overloading support
	and to handle references to tied variables.

	Rewrote leading blurb about compatibility to make it clearer what
	"backward compatibility" is about: when I say 0.7 is backward
	compatible with 0.6, it means the revision 0.7 can read files
	produced by 0.6.

	Mention new Clone(3) extension in SEE ALSO.

	Was wrongly optimizing for "undef" values in hashes by not
	fully recursing: as a result, tied "undef" values were incorrectly
	serialized.

Sun Jul 30 12:59:17 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

	First revision of Storable 0.7.

	The serializing format is new, known as version 2.0.  It is fully
	backward compatible with 0.6.  Earlier formats are deprecated and
	have not even been tested: next version will drop pre-0.6 format.

	Changes since 0.6@11:

	- Moved interface to the "beta" status.  Some tiny parts are still
	  subject to change, but nothing important enough to warrant an "alpha"
	  status any longer.

	- Slightly reduced the size of the Storable image by factorizing
	  object class names and removing final object storage notification due
	  to a redesign of the blessed object storing.

	- Classes can now redefine how they wish their instances to be serialized
	  and/or deep cloned.  Serializing hooks are written in Perl code.

	- The engine is now fully re-entrant.

Sun Apr  2 23:47:50 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added provision to detect more recent binary formats, since
	the new upcoming Storable-0.7 will use a different format.
	In order to prevent attempting the de-serialization of newer
	formats by older versions, I'm adding this now to the 0.6 series.

	I'm expecting this revision to be the last of the 0.6 series.
	Unless it does not work with perl 5.6, which I don't use yet,
	and therefore against which I cannot test.

Wed Mar 29 19:55:21 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added note about format incompatibilities with old versions
	(i.e. pre 0.5@9 formats, which cannot be understood as there
	was no versionning information in the file by then).

	Protect all $@ variables when eval {} used, to avoid corrupting
	it when store/retrieve is called within an exception handler.

	Mistakenly included "patchlevel.h" instead of <patchlevel.h>,
	preventing Perl's patchlevel from being included, which is
	needed starting from 5.6.

Tue May 12 09:15:15 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Fixed shared "undef" bug in hashes, which did not remain shared
	through store/retrieve.

Thu Feb 10 19:48:16 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	added last_op_in_netorder() predicate
	documented last_op_in_netorder()
	added tests for the new last_op_in_netorder() predicate

Wed Oct 20 19:07:36 MEST 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Forgot to update VERSION

Tue Oct 19 21:25:02 MEST 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added mention of japanese translation for the manual page.

	Fixed typo in macro that made threaded code not compilable,
	especially on Win32 platforms.

	Changed detection of older perls (pre-5.005) by testing PATCHLEVEL
	directly instead of relying on internal symbols.

Tue Sep 14 22:13:28 MEST 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Integrated "thread-safe" patch from Murray Nesbitt.
	Note that this may not be very efficient for threaded code,
	see comment in the code.

	Try to avoid compilation warning on 64-bit CPUs. Can't test it,
	since I don't have access to such machines.

Mon Jul 12 14:37:19 METDST 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	changed my e-mail to pobox.

	mentionned it is not thread-safe.

	updated version number.

	uses new internal PL_* naming convention.

Fri Jul  3 13:38:16 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated benchmark figures due to recent optimizations done in
	store(): tagnums are now stored as-is in the hash table, so
	no surrounding SV is created. And the "shared keys" mode for
	hash table was turned off.

	Fixed backward compatibility (wrt 0.5@9) for retrieval of
	blessed refs. That old version did something wrong, but the
	bugfix prevented correct retrieval of the old format.

Mon Jun 22 11:00:48 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Changed benchmark figures.

	Adjust refcnt of tied objects after calling sv_magic() to avoid
	memory leaks.  Contributed by Jeff Gresham.

Fri Jun 12 11:50:04 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Added workaround for persistent LVALUE-ness in perl5.004. All
	scalars tagged as being an lvalue are handled as if they were
	not an lvalue at all.  Added test for that LVALUE bug workaround.

	Now handles Perl immortal scalars explicitely, by storing &sv_yes
	as such, explicitely.

	Retrieval of non-immortal undef cannot be shared. Previous
	version was over-optimizing by not creating a separate SV for
	all undefined scalars seen.

Thu Jun  4 17:21:51 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Baseline for Storable-0.6@0.

	This version introduces a binary incompatibility in the generated
	binary image, which is more compact than older ones by approximatively
	15%, depending on the exact degree of sharing in your structures.

	The good news is that your older images can still be retrieved with
	this version, i.e. backward compatibility is preserved. This version
	of Storable can only generate new binaries however.

	Another good news is that the retrieval of data structure is
	significantly quicker than before, because a Perl array is used
	instead of a hash table to keep track of retrieved objects, and
	also because the image being smaller, less I/O function calls are
	made.

Tue May 12 09:15:15 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Version number now got from Storable.pm directly.

	Fixed overzealous sv_type() optimization, which would make
	Storable fail when faced with an "upgraded" SV to the PVIV
	or PVNV kind containing a reference.

Thu Apr 30 15:11:30 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Extended the SYNOPSIS section to give quick overview of the
	routines and their signature.

	Optimized sv_type() to avoid flags checking when not needed, i.e.
	when their type makes it impossible for them to be refs or tied.
	This slightly increases throughput by a few percents when refs
	and tied variables are marginal occurrences in your data.

	Stubs for XS now use OutputStream and InputStream file types to
	make it work when the given file is actually a socket. Perl
	makes a distinction for sockets in its internal I/O structures
	by having both a read and a write structure, whereas plain files
	share the same one.

Tue Jun  3 09:41:33 METDST 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Thanks to a contribution from Benjamin A. Holzman, Storable is now
	able to correctly serialize tied SVs, i.e. tied arrays, hashes
	and scalars.

Thu Apr  9 18:07:51 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	I said SvPOK() had changed to SvPOKp(), but that was a lie...

Wed Apr  8 13:14:29 METDST 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Wrote sizeof(SV *) instead of sizeof(I32) when portable, which
	in effect mangled the object tags and prevented portability
	accross 32/64 bit architectures!

Wed Mar 25 14:57:02 MET 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Added code example for store_fd() and retrieve_fd() in the
	man page, to emphasize that file descriptors must be passed as
	globs, not as plain strings.

	Cannot use SV addresses as tag when using nstore() on LP64. This
	was the cause of problems when creating a storable image on an
	LP64 machine and retrieving it on an ILP32 system, which is
	exactly what nstore() is meant for...

	However, we continue to use SV addresses as tags for plain store(),
	because benchamarking shows that it saves up to 8% of the store
	time, and store() is meant to be fast at the expense of lack
	of portability.

	This means there will be approximately an 8% degradation of
	performance for nstore(), but it's now working as expected.
	That cost may vary on your machine of course, since it is
	solely caused by the memory allocation overhead used to create
	unique SV tags for each distinct stored SV.

Tue Jan 20 09:21:53 MET 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Don't use any '_' in version number.

Tue Jan 13 17:51:50 MET 1998   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number.

	added binmode() calls for systems where it matters.

	Be sure to pass globs, not plain file strings, to C routines,
	so that Storable can be used under the Perl debugger.

Wed Nov  5 10:53:22 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Fix memory leaks on seen hash table and returned SV refs.

	Storable did not work properly when tainting enabled.

	Fixed "Allocation too large" messages in freeze/thaw and added.
	proper regression test in t/freeze.t.

Tue Jun  3 09:41:33 METDST 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Added freeze/thaw interface and dclone.

Fri May 16 10:45:47 METDST 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Forgot that AutoLoader does not export its own AUTOLOAD.
	I could use

		use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';
	
	but that would not be backward compatible. So the export is
	done by hand...

Tue Mar 25 11:21:32 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Empty scalar strings are now "defined" at retrieval time.

	New test to ensure an empty string is defined when retrieved.

Thu Feb 27 16:32:44 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Declare VERSION as being used

	Fixed a typo in the PerlIO_putc remapping.
	PerlIO_read and perlIO_write inverted size/nb_items.
	(only relevant for pre-perl5.004 versions)

Thu Feb 27 15:58:31 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number

	Added VERSION identification

	Allow build with perl5.003, which is ante perlIO time

Mon Jan 13 17:53:18 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Random code fixes.

Wed Jan 22 15:19:56 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number in Makefile.PL.

	Added "thanks to" section to README.

	Documented new forgive_me variable.

	Made 64-bit clean.

	Added forgive_me support to allow store() of data structures
	containing non-storable items like CODE refs.
