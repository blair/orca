Orca:
	Come up with a better error scheme than using warn() for some
		errors and the email warn for others.
	Do something better if the number of columns changes in a single
		percollator file.
	Have a scheme were at any point of time a data file may add or
		change the number of columns of data and column names.
	Lock file.
	Arbitrary date reading.
	Use Cricket's configuration ConfigTree?????
	More configuration file defaults.
	Better date loading support.
	Make plots from multiple files sets: delete source files_key and put
		it into data.
	Update HTML files if a new file is found with a new group.
	Update percollator.cfg.in for caching and proxy stuff.

percollator.se:
	Better documentation.
