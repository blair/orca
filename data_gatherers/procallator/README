Linux ORCA-aware statistics collector

This piece of software is for use with Orca, by Blair Zajac - 
http://www.orcaware.com/ - and intends to provide relevant system statistics
in a friendly and graphical interface.

Requirements:
- A running Orca server.
- perl 5 installed on target linux systems
- a mechanism for remote distribution of software to send collected
  stats from the target to the server.

I use rsync, but anything, ranging from ftp to NFS will do fine.
Check the update_orca_server.sh script (I use it in crontab) for
reference on doing it.

Installation:	
The installation is quite simple. It installs with orca normal installations
For instructions check orca documents

This software is in alpha stage, use at your own risk.
