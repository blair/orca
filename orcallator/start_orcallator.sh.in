When you configured Orca the se executable was not found.  If you
do not have the SE toolkit installed on your system, then follow
the steps in section 10 of INSTALL file that came with Orca.

Once you have the SE toolkit installed on your system, then either
rerun configure so that it finds se, or edit start_orcallator.sh
and define SE to the location of se.
