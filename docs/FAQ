Orcallator:
 1) Why are my Ethernet bits/second measurements all 0?

    On 2.5.1 or older Solaris operating system releases, the kernel does
    not measure the bits/second going through a particular device.  I
    believe some later kernel and device driver patches may fix this,
    but Solaris 2.6 and greater definitely does measure this.
