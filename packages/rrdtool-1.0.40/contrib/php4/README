This is an adapted version of rrdtool for the php-4.0.6 version 
of the RedHat sourcecode. Just go into the main php
Directory, say php-4.0.6, go into the ext Directory and untar this
tar-file.

call: ./buildconf in the Main php-4.0.6 directory
add "--with-rrdtool" to the general ./configure call.

And you'r done.

NOTE: You need rrdtool-1.0.38 to be installed forthis to compile properly.
