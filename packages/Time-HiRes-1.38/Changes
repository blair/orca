Revision history for Perl extension Time::HiRes.

1.20  Wed Feb 24 21:30 1999
	- make our usleep and ualarm substitutes into hrt_usleep 
	  and hrt_ualarm. This helps static links of Perl with other
	  packages that also have usleep, etc. From
	  Ilya Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>
	- add C API stuff. From Joshua Pritikin
	  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>
	- VMS Makefile.PL fun.  From pvhp@forte.com (Peter Prymmer)
	- hopefully correct "-lc" fix for SCO.
	- add PPD stuff

1.19  Tue Sep 29 22:30 1998
	- put VMS gettimeofday() in. Patch is from Sebastian Bazley
	  <seb@stian.demon.co.uk>
	- change GIMME_V to GIMME to help people with older versions of
	  Perl.
	- fix Win32 version of gettimeofday(). It didn't affect anything,
	  but it confuses people reading the code when the return value
	  is backwards (0 is success).
	- fix Makefile.PL (more) so that detection of gettimeofday is
	  more correct.

1.18  Mon Jul 6 22:40 1998
	- add usleep() for Win32.
	- fix Makefile.PL to fix reported HP/UX feature where unresolved
	  externals still cause an executable to be generated (though no
	  x bit set). Thanks to David Kozinn for report and explanation.
	  Problems with the fix are mine :)

1.17  Wed Jul 1 20:10 1998
	- fix setitimer calls so microseconds is not more than 1000000.
	  Hp/UX 9 doesn't like that. Provided by Roland B Robert, PhD.
        - make Win32. We only get gettimeofday (the select hack doesn't
	  seem to work on my Win95 system).
        - fix test 4 on 01test.t. add test to see if time() and 
	  Time::HiRes::time() are close.

1.16  Wed Nov 12 21:05 1997
	- add missing EXTEND in new gettimeofday scalar code.

1.15  Mon Nov 10 21:30 1997
	- HiRes.pm: update pod. Provided by Gisle Aas.
	- HiRes.xs: if gettimeofday() called in scalar context, do
	  something more useful than before. Provided by Gisle Aas.
	- README: tell of xsubpp '-nolinenumber' woes. thanks to
	  Edward Henigin <ed@texas.net> for pointing out the problem.

1.14  Wed Nov 5 9:40 1997
	- Makefile.PL: look for setitimer
	- HiRes.xs: if missing ualarm, but we have setitimer, make up
	  our own setitimer. These were provided by Gisle Aas.

1.13  Tue Nov 4 23:30 1997
	- Makefile.PL: fix autodetect mechanism to do try linking in addition
	  to just compiling; should fix Linux build problem. Fix was provided
	  by Gisle Aas.

1.12  Sun Oct 12 12:00:00 1997
	- Makefile.PL: set XSOPT to '-nolinenumbers' to work around xsubpp bug;
	  you may need to comment this back out if you have an older xsubpp.
	- HiRes.xs: set PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

1.11  Fri Sep 05 16:00:00 1997
	- Makefile.PL:
	  Had some line commented out that shouldn't have been (testing
	  remnants)
	- README:
	  Previous version was corrupted.

1.10  Thu May 22 20:20:00 1997
	- HiRes.xs, HiRes.pm, t/*:
	      -	only compile what we have OS support for (or can 
		fake with select())
	      - only test what we compiled 
	      - gross improvement to the test suite
	      - fix EXPORT_FAIL. 
	  This work was all done by Roderick Schertler
	  <roderick@argon.org>. If you run Linux or
	  one of the other ualarm-less platoforms, and you like this 
	  module, let Roderick know; without him, it still wouldn't 
	  be working on those boxes...
	- Makefile.PL: figure out what routines the OS has and
	  only build what we need. These bits were written by Jarkko 
	  Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>. Again, gratitude is due...

1.02  Mon Dec 30 08:00:00 1996
	- HiRes.pm: update documentation to say what to do when missing
	  ualarm() and friends.
	- README: update to warn that ualarm() and friends need to exist

1.01  Fri Oct 17 08:00:00 1996
	- Makefile.PL: make XSPROTOARGS => '-noprototyopes'
	- HiRes.pm: put blank line between __END__ and =head1 so that 
	  pod2man works.

1.00  Tue Sep 03 13:00:00 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16
