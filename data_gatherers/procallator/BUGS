These are the current documented BUGs in procallator:

Version 0.3 - and probably the older versions
- When running as a guest OS in MWARE Workstation the perl sleep funcion (that
  calls nanosleep system call) seems to hang when the virtual machine is idle 
  (or with low load).  There is no known workaroud, and apparently it happens
  with other programas using this system call. Have to confirm that this occurs
  with other installations and verify viable alternatives, like time-hires or 
  other ways to create reliable timers on vmware guests.
