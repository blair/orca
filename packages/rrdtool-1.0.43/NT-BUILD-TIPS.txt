Compiling RRDtool on NT ... work in progress
---------------------------------------------------------------

Persisting Problems with the current NT port:

Unfortunately, the RRD perl modules does not work with Perl
(ActivePerl) using the current distribution.

The RRD shared perl module can be compiled after some
modification...

Follow these steps:

0. Install perl if you do not have it!
   Visit http://www.ActiveState.com/pw32/ for a complete distribution.

1. Copy ..\gd1.2\release\gd.lib  to ..\gd1.2\
2. Copy ..\src\release\rrd.lib to ..\src
3. perl Makefile.pl

In this step the system complains about something I do not
understand. The error message is the following:

Note (probably harmless): No library found for '-lm'

Is a library missing? But it does not stop with an error...

4. nmake test (You must have Visual C++ on the machine!)

After these steps it generates the test files (gifs and rrds),
and they seem to be good.

The real problem in the shared perl modul is the following:

I do not know how this installation stuff works. The problem is
that the installation stuff looks for the gd.lib and the
rrd.lib in the ..\gd1.2 and ..\src directory. The UNIX compile
puts the files into these directories, but the NT compile does
not.

It is all for today,
