Thu Oct 14 14:44:00 PDT 1999

	Release Orca 0.24.

Thu Oct 14 12:17:29 PDT 1999

	Back down to RRDtool 1.0.7 with only my filename length patch
	applied per Tobi.

	Revamp the INSTALL, NEWS, and other files to get a release out.

	Up the version number of the included RRDs package to 1.000072
	since it contains some patches specifically for Orca.

Wed Oct 13 12:40:29 PDT 1999

	Orcallator.se 1.19 prevents a division by zero in calculating
	the mean_disk_busy if the number of disks on the system is 0.

	Move the URL http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/orcallator-docs/
	to http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/docs/orcallator.html.

	In cases where there are a large number of data sources in a
	single image, then the list of available colors is expired.
	Now reuse the colors.

	Make sure plots are displayed in each subgroup's HTML files in
	the order they appear in the configuration file.

Tue Oct 12 10:27:44 PDT 1999

	Update orcallator.cfg to remove the maximum and average disk busy
	plot and add a plot that displays the run percent for each disk.

	Orcallator 1.18 now renames disk_runp.c?t?d? to disk_runp_c?t?d?.

Mon Oct 11 14:31:38 PDT 1999

	Update orcallator.cfg to plot the disk space and inode usage
	for all locally mounted filesystems.

	Apply a patch to RRDtool that increases the maximum filename
	length for generated image files from 255 to 1024.

	Rename &strip_key_name to &escape_name.

Fri Oct  8 14:23:37 PDT 1999

	Save even more space in Orca generated HTML and image filenames.
	On large directories, up to 10% disk space can be saved alone
	in filenames according to du.  Also, if generated filenames are
	longer than 235 characters, then compute a MD5 hash of the name,
	trim the name down to 210 characters, and append the MD5 hash.

	Orcallator.se 1.17 now skips locally mounted /cdrom filesystems.

	Increase the number of default known colors to 11.

Wed Oct  6 17:59:05 PDT 1999

	Orcallator.se 1.16 now compresses its log files after it has
	completed a day's log using the command in the COMPRESSOR
	environmental variable.  start_orcallator now passed this
	environmental variable to orcallator.se.

Wed Oct  6 15:19:09 PDT 1999

	Have configure.in look for bzip2, bunzip2, gzip, gunzip, compress,
	and uncompress.  Define the COMPRESSOR and UNCOMPRESSOR_PIPE as
	the best compression tool to use and add these names to the list
	of names being substituted.  This only gets defined if both a
	compress and uncompression tool is used.

	To keep backwards compatibility in orcallator.se, define WATCH_WEB
	if WATCH_HTTPD is defined.

Tue Oct  5 14:54:59 PDT 1999

	Update orcallator.se to 1.15.  kvm$mpid is a int not a long.
	This caused problems on Solaris 7 hosts running a 64 bit kernel.

Fri Oct  1 12:15:47 PDT 1999

	Update orcallator.se to 1.14.  Rename disk.c?t?d? column names
	to disk_runp.c?t?d? to better reflect the data being recorded
	and to allow for more per disk information later.

	Install the latest RRDtool patch.

Thu Sep 29 19:19:23 PDT 1999

	Add some more space between a plot's legend and the minimum,
	maximum, etc information for a particular piece of data.

	Allow mathematical expressions in plots where the first data
	contains a regular expression.

Fri Sep 24 11:50:33 PDT 1999

	Many fixes and improvements to orcallator.se.  Fix a bug in the
	disk_mean calculation where it was being divided by the wrong
	disk_count.  Now it should be much larger and in scale with
	disk_peak.  When WATCH_DISK is defined, now print each disk's
	run percent.  Add a new define WATCH_MOUNTS, which reports each
	mount point's disk space and inode capacity, usage, available
	for non-root users and percent used.  This comes from Duncan
	Lawie tyger@hoopoes.com.  Add some smarts so that if the number
	of interfaces, physical disk, or mounted partitions changes,
	then a new header is printed.  This will prevent column name
	and data mixups when the system configuration changes.

Mon Sep 20 11:18:21 PDT 1999

	Include Storable 0.6.5.

Tue Sep 14 15:54:38 PDT 1999

	Add the page scan rate to orcallator.se as column scanrate.

Tue Sep  7 12:21:52 PDT 1999

	Update the archive URLs for the orca-* mailing lists.

Thu Sep  2 11:03:19 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.7.

	Make some more minor changes to have Orca run with Perl 5.004_01.

Tue Aug 24 11:32:34 PDT 1999

	Include and require Math::Interpolate 1.05.

Thu Aug 19 14:13:16 PDT 1999

	No longer include Compress::Zlib, which was to be used to read in
	compressed source data files without spawning a separate process.
	Now it seems easier to just call gunzip -c.

Wed Aug 18 11:10:21 PDT 1999

	Read in .gz files using gunzip, .Z files using uncompress,
	and .bz2 files with bunzip2.

	Clean up some bugs where the RRDs::graph -r option would always
	be used.

	Plots can now take a logarithmic option which specified that
	the Y axis will have a logarithmic scale.

Tue Aug 17 11:50:34 PDT 1999

	Include and require Math::Interpolate 1.04.

Mon Aug 16 12:11:48 PDT 1999

	Add locking on a particular configuration file.  Make a directory
	using the configuration filename.

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.6.

Fri Aug 13 17:10:23 PDT 1999

	Install librrd.so on Solaris hosts in $libdir so that
	orcallator.se can attach to it.

Fri Aug 13 15:35:21 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.5.

Mon Aug  9 10:32:42 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.4.

Fri Aug  6 09:29:14 PDT 1999

	Include Digest::MD5 2.09 but continue to only require 2.00.

Thu Aug  5 20:58:32 PDT 1999

	Make sure start_orcallator looks to see if SE is defined.  If it
	is not, then print a message stating where to find the SE toolkit.

Fri Jul 30 09:12:20 PDT 1999

	Update orcallator.cfg to plot the new process spawn rate.

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.3.

Thu Jul 29 10:36:20 PDT 1999

	To fix the problem of too long HTML and image file names,
	shorten the names as they get passed through strip_key_name.
	Now orcallator -> o, orca -> o, _times_ -> _X_, _percent_ ->
	_pct_, _number_ -> _num_.  The upgrade_installation will perform
	these renames on a list of directories.

	Since orcallator is only one of many different data gatherers,
	move it into its own directory.

Wed Jul 28 10:10:53 PDT 1999

	If WATCH_CPU is defined and if the user can read /dev/kmem then
	orcallator.se will now measure the process spawn rate over a 5
	minute interval and also record the maximum rate measured over
	a 5 second interval.

	Add a href field for a plot in the configuration file.	This,
	if defined, lets you make a particular target type be a HREF to
	read something about that target type.

	Include Digest::MD5 2.08 but continue to only require 2.00.

Fri Jul 23 13:41:36 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.1.

Thu Jul 22 17:06:45 PDT 1999

	Use a blessed reference to an array for the Orca::DataFile,
	Orca::HTMLFile, Orca::ImageFile, Orca::OpenFileHash,
	Orca::RRDFile, and Orca::OpenFileHash classes.

Mon Jul 19 12:57:56 PDT 1999

	On a fresh install make sure to mkdir RRD_DIR/orcallator.

	Change the tag name data_dir to rrd_dir to make it clearer what
	kind of data is being loaded.

	Integrate building of Compress::Zlib into the Makefile structure.
	Make use of the Zlib 1.1.3 library included with RRDtool for
	Compress::Zlib.

Fri Jul 16 11:12:02 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 1.0.0 and Compress::Zlib 1.05.

	Update the colors in orcallator.cfg.  In all plots, make one
	plot use area.

Thu Jul 15 11:35:52 PDT 1999

	As noted by Bob Hoekstra <Bob_Hoekstra@merck.com>, orcallator.se
	was outputting the same information for ??load as for ??runq.
	Orcallator.se no longer generates that data and orcallator.cfg
	no longer generates plots for it.

Wed Jul 14 11:04:09 PDT 1999

	Switch to use PNGs instead of GIFs.  They take up 1/3 less space
	than GIFs and at least 10% less time to generate.

	Revamp the INSTALL document to reflect the new * -> _times_
	change and add some documentation of the file descriptor limit.

	Uncompress and read .Z and .gz compressed input files on the fly.

Wed Jul 14 10:22:13 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.52.

Tue Jul 13 12:34:29 PDT 1999

	Include Storable 0.604 but continue to only require 0.603.

Thu Jul  8 16:22:45 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.50.

Wed Jul  7 13:26:55 PDT 1999

	Rename the migrate_to_orcallator script to upgrade_installation.

	Per Vadim Shulkin <vadim.shulkin@csfb.com> request, replace the
	* in all generated filenames with _times_.  Put this rename in
	the new upgrade_installation script.

Tue Jul  6 18:14:20 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.49.

Sun Jul  4 16:57:28 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.47.

Fri Jul  2 18:16:21 PDT 1999

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.46.

Tue Jun 29 13:18:57 PDT 1999

	Add a new option for each plot named base that allows the base
	for each plot to be either 1000 or 1024.  This allows for plotting
	of memory or network type of datas.

	Use the new base option in the number of bytes of available swap
	space plots.

	Include and require RRDtool 0.99.45.

	Make use of RRDtool's 0.99.45 capability to place the SI number
	suffix to numbers appearing in the legend using the GPRINT
	command.

Mon Jun 28 11:16:46 PDT 1999

	Now only print found filenames if the verbose level is above one.
	Orca was generating too much output.

	When creating all the HTML files, do not write directly to the
	new filename, instead write to a temporary filename and when
	the file is closed, then rename it to the final name.  This lets
	the user view existing HTML files even when the new HTML files
	are being updated.

	Include RRDtool 0.99.41 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

Tue Jun 22 10:54:39 PDT 1999

	Include RRDtool 0.99.40 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

Thu Jun 10 09:39:36 PDT 1999

	When 80% of a host's processes are web serving processes, plotting
	the total system and number of httpd's together on the same plot
	makes sense.  However, for people running a tiny web server with
	only a few processes, this does not make sense, so a separate
	plot is created.  Noted by Paul Company <paul.company@plpt.com>.

Tue Jun  8 10:57:39 PDT 1999

	Make the table of contents in INSTALL consistent with the contents
	of the file.

Mon Jun  7 13:01:05 PDT 1999

	Include RRDtool 0.99.32 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

Thu Jun  3 13:27:09 PDT 1999

	Fix a bug in Orca::SourceDataFile::add_plots where it was
	dereferencing an undef.

	Since orcallator.se may watch many different types of web
	server logs, move some of the common code into CPP defines.
	Defines are preferred over functions since the function call
	overhead in SE is larger than having the code inlined.

	Have orcallator.se watch Yahoo! style web access logs if
	-DWATCH_YAHOO is passed on the command line.

	If any of the environmental variables used by orcallator.se were
	defined then the value was used, even if the length was zero.
	Now the length of the variable must be non-zero for the value
	to be used, otherwise the default value is used.

Wed Jun  2 12:11:44 PDT 1999

	Optimize orcallator.se slightly when it determines the size bin
	for a particular file served.

	Change the define WATCH_HTTPD in orcallator.se to WATCH_WEB to
	be consistent with the other WEB_* defines and environmental
	variables.

Tue Jun  1 21:53:15 PDT 1999

	For orcallator.se, if the WEB_SERVER environmental variable
	is set, then the value of of WEB_SERVER is used to count the
	number of web server processes.  If WEB_SERVER is not defined
	it defaults to httpd.

Fri May 28 17:39:36 PDT 1999

	Add to the plot title the type of the plot, i.e. 'Yearly',
	in every GIF.  Requested by Tom Murray <murray@reston.wcom.net>.

Thu May 27 10:53:02 PDT 1999

	Release version 0.23.

Thu May 27 09:24:20 PDT 1999

	Add another optimization that saves the result of computing how
	old each GIF must be before it is recreated.

	Fix a bug noted by Peter Radcliffe <pir@pir.net> where I missed
	changing some PERCOLLATOR_DIR variables to ORCALLATOR_DIR in
	src/start_orcallator.sh.in and src/orcallator_running.pl.in.

Wed May 26 17:54:26 PDT 1999

	Release version 0.22.

Wed May 26 12:10:42 PDT 1999

	Move the portions of the code that generate the RRDs::graph
	options that do not change between invocations to the
	_update_graph_options method.  This method gets called when the
	Orca::GIFFile is constructed and any time add_rrds is called.
	This speeds Orca up slightly.

	Include RRDtool 0.99.31 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

	Add a new quarterly plot that shows the last 100 days.	This is
	a nice transition between the monthly and yearly plots.

	Change the number of days shown in the yearly plot from 500 to
	428, which is one year and two months.	Reducing the number
	of days from 500 by at least one day will speed up the GIF
	generation time because by default the plot portion of the GIFs
	are 500 pixels wide.

	Add two new classes Orca::Config::Plot and
	Orca::Config::FilesGroup that do not do anything yet but
	will provide an object-oriented interface to config_plots and
	config_files.  Currently all the values in @$config_plots and
	%$config_files are now bless objects instead of unblessed objects.

Thu May 20 10:59:26 PDT 1999

	Put a closing ) in a error message in RRDtool 0.99.29.1.

	Fix a bug in queue_data where it was sending data to rrd_update
	that was already in the RRD file.

Wed May 19 10:43:48 PDT 1999

	Remove the load_state and save_state subroutines and replace
	them with an object-oriented Orca::State class for saving
	information between Orca invocations.  Use the Storable class
	to save information instead of a text based method.

	Restructured the code so each Orca::SourceDataFile has only one
	anonymous subroutine to read in all the valued from a single
	line of the source data file.  This sped Orca up slightly.

	Add a -r option to Orca to have it not create any HTML or GIF
	files and only update the RRD files.

	Fix a bug where if the number of columns changed in from
	one source file to the next source file in a files group,
	the column index used to get a particular value is the old
	index for the old file and not the new index for the new file.
	This fix involved having the Orca::SourceDataFile object run
	the anonymous subroutines to pick the correct data from a line
	instead of Orca::RRDFile.

	Remove some unused methods: Orca::OpenFileHash::list,
	Orca::OpenFileHash::select, Orca::OpenFileHash::sysread_readline
	Add some more documentation to orcallator.cfg.

	Skip a line in an input source data file if the word timestamp
	is found in it.  This is a temporary fix.

Mon May 17 16:26:17 PDT 1999

	Release version 0.21.

Mon May 17 15:07:33 PDT 1999

	Correct a bug when a source data file cannot be loaded it should
	not used to look up a Orca::SourceDataFile object.

	Reformat all the comments in orca.pl.

Thu May 13 10:47:41 PDT 1999

	Orca used to delete RRD files if they had an $ORCA_RRD_VERSION
	number newer then the required version number.	Now use them.
	Add code to remember the Orca RRD version number so that the
	GIF creation code works properly with RRD files with a version
	different than $ORCA_RRD_VERSION.

	Thanks to a configure file and some data from from Eric Blaise
	<Eric.Blaise@socgen.com>, Orca can now handle plots containing
	columns of data that do not exist in all input source data files.

	In add_plots, a linear search was used to convert column
	description names appearing in data statements to an index into
	the column_description array.  Now use a hash table look up.

Wed May 12 09:31:43 PDT 1999

	Orca now cleans up all file paths in the input configuration file.
	If more than one / are found in a row, they are replaced by one /.
	The base_dir is only prepended to paths if the path does not
	match ^\\?\.{0,2}/, which will match on /, ./, ../, and \./.

	The paths used to find input files are now passed through
	the following regular expressions: s:^\\./:: and s:/\\./:/:g.
	These remove unnecessary searches through the current directory.

	Perl_glob will only return found files and no other type.
	It will also not follow any directories named `..'.

	Include RRDtool 0.99.29.1 with Orca.  This includes a Makefile
	patch and does not include a new version of RRDs.pm or librrd.

	In any Makefile.in's that run config.status, they used to run
	a make from the top level directory.  Now they only run a make
	from the directory that required the running of config.status.

Tue May 11 16:24:09 PDT 1999

	In places where deep copies of data structures are made and no
	s///'s are performed on the text form of data, use dclone that
	comes with Storable instead of using Data::Dumper and eval.

	Do not prepend base_dir to any paths if they begin with either
	`/' or `./'.

	Require and include RRDtool 0.99.29 with Orca.

	Orca now includes the four Perl packages it depends upon:
	Digest::MD5 2.07, Math::Interpolate 1.02, RRDtool 0.99.29,
	and Storable 0.6@3.

Mon May 10 10:46:36 PDT 1999

	Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.07 and require
	RRDtool 0.99.28.

Sat May  8 19:29:14 PDT 1999

	Upgrade the instructions to mention Math::Interpolate 1.02
	instead of Math::Interpolator 1.01.

Thu May  6 13:58:06 PDT 1999

	Orca does not normally display the daily, weekly, monthly,
	yearly, and everything plots for all the different measurements
	if there is only one group.  However, it is nice to see all the
	different measurement plots in one page for a single group, so if
	now there is only one group, then an Everything group placed at
	the top of the main index.html file for daily, weekly, monthly,
	and yearly overviews.

	Make a comment about using gd1.3 versus gd1.2 in INSTALL when
	building RRDtool.  Because RRDtool comes with gd1.2 and generates
	smaller GIFs, a comment is made that there is no reason to move
	to gd1.3.  The bottom line is that gd1.2 is preferred.

	Check if the state file is empty and do not complain if it is.

	Add installation instructions that to install this version
	of Orca over an older version, a make migrate command will
	need to be run to renames all files and directories containing
	percollator, percol, or perc to orcallator in any of the installed
	Orca directories.

	Update orcallator.cfg to look for filenames like
	orcallator-1999-05-06 and percol-1999-05-06.

Wed May  5 10:43:23 PDT 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.27.

Mon May  3 14:51:06 PDT 1999

	Rename everything percollator, perc and percol to orcallator.

Fri Apr 30 16:34:20 PDT 1999

	Update to install Perl 5.005_03 instead of 5.005_02.

Fri Apr 23 09:31:28 PDT 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.25.

Thu Apr 22 09:21:15 PDT 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.24.

Sat Apr 17 12:06:46 PDT 1999

	Change all URLs from
	    http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Thinktank/4996/
	to
	    http://www.geocities.com/~bzking/

Thu Apr  8 17:03:37 PDT 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.23.

Wed Mar 31 19:07:41 PST 1999

	When perl_glob cannot open a directory, return an empty
	array and warn instead of dying.  Fix from J.R. Tietsort
	<jrtietsort@micron.com>.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.22 which contains a memory leak bug fix.

Sat Mar 27 10:07:09 PST 1999

	Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.06 and require
	RRDtool 0.99.21.

Thu Mar 25 15:30:00 PST 1999

	Speed up count_proc() in percollator.se by 20% using a patch
	supplied by Rich Pettit <rpettit@resolute.com>.

Sat Mar  6 11:50:57 PST 1999

	Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.04.

Thu Mar  4 16:42:03 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.19.

Mon Mar  1 11:01:01 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.18.

Tue Feb 23 09:19:37 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.15.

	Die if a unrecognized command line option is given to Orca.

	Do group name substitution on the Y legend in GIFs.

	Add another consolidation function, DERIVE, to an error message.

	Change the user, system and idle colors in the CPU usage plot
	as requested by Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.

	Change the printing format of usr% and sys% from %4.0f to %5.1f
	in percollator.se to work around a printing problem reported by
	Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.  In SE 3.1 this will now
	display an extra non-zero digit of measured precision.

	Always output the header information in percollator.se, even
	if Orca cannot handle it yet, since the number of columns may
	change if new hardware is added to the system.

Mon Feb 22 10:23:21 PST 1999

	Add GIF width and height tags to img src's using the returned
	GIF size from RRDs::graph.

	Add a space between the ending " for the img src="" and the
	following alt="" in the generated HTML.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.14.

	Add x86 Ethernet device plotting to percollator.cfg.in.

	Remove the LAST RRA from all Orca created RRAs since it is not
	required to get the current value from an RRA.	The current
	value is obtained by using the LAST consolidation function on
	the plotted data.

Sun Feb 21 11:03:39 PST 1999

	Make use of RRDtool 0.99.12's legend formatting.

Sat Feb 20 20:13:01 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.12.

Fri Feb 19 11:55:50 PST 1999

	Move some </a> tags to the end of the image they were referencing
	to remove some Netscape glitches.

	Minor spelling fix and addition to CHANGES file.

	Version 0.20.

	Have the Orca logo be a hyperlink to the Orca home page.

	Version 0.19.

	Fix a bug in copying SE 3.1's percollator.se changes where it
	was not skipping the HTTP/1.x code in the NCSA style access log.
	Now percollator.se can handle log files with or without the code.

Thu Feb 18 11:54:03 PST 1999

	percollator.se now logs information on integral multiples of
	the interval.  This is useful for RRD which expects data to be
	measured on the interval.

	Fix a bug in percollator.se where it was inflating the httpops5
	number since it was not calculating the actual time interval
	and instead assuming a 5 second interval.

	Add Squid log processing to percollator.se courtesy of Adrian
	Cockcroft of Sun Microsystems.

	Rename the configure --with options.  If you want to watch NCSA
	style access logs, use --with-ncsa-log.  To watch NCSA style
	proxy access logs, use --with-proxy-log.  And to watch Squid
	access log, use --with-squid-log.

	Version 0.18.

	Minor fixes.

	Version 0.17.

	Group names are now sorted depending upon the format of the
	group names.  For example, this now will list nfs13 after nfs5,
	even though cmp will sort nfs13 before nfs5.

	Created GIFs now print the current measured value in addition
	to the average measured value.

	percollator.cfg.in updated to shorten the http and inode with
	page steals legends to have shorter legends so that RRDtool will
	plot the whole comment along with the average and last value in
	the GIF.
