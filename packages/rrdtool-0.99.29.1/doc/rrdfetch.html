The <STRONG>fetch</STRONG> function is normally used internally by the graph function, to get data
from <STRONG>RRD</STRONG>s. <STRONG>fetch</STRONG> will analyze the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG> and will try to retrieve the data in the resolution requested. The data
fetched is printed to stdout. <EM>*UNKNOWN*</EM> data is often represented by the string ``NaN'' depending on your OSs
printf function.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_filename">filename

the name of the <STRONG>RRD</STRONG> you want to fetch the data from.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CF">CF

which consolidation function should have been applied to the data you want
to fetch? (AVERAGE,MIN,MAX,LAST)

</A></STRONG><DD>
what interval should the values have (seconds per value). <STRONG>rrdfetch</STRONG> will try to match your request, but it will return data even if no absolute
match is possible.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__start_s">--start|-s start (default -24*3600)

</A></STRONG><DD>
when should the data begin. A time in seconds since epoch (1970-01-01) is
required. Negative numbers are relative to the end time. By default one day
worth of data will be fetched. See also AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION section
for alternative ways to specify start time.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__end_e">--end|-e end (default current time)

</A></STRONG><DD>
when should the data end. Time in seconds since epoch. See also AT-STYLE
TIME SPECIFICATION section for alternative ways to specify end time.

<H2><A NAME="AT_STYLE_TIME_SPECIFICATION">AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION

</A></H2>
The rrdtool does also understand at-style time specification. The
specification is called ``at-style'' after unix command <CODE>at(1)</CODE>
that has moderately complex ways to specify time to run your job at. The
at-style specification consists of two parts: <STRONG>TIME REFERENCE</STRONG>
specification and <STRONG>TIME OFFSET</STRONG> specification.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="TIME_REFERENCE_SPECIFICATION">TIME REFERENCE SPECIFICATION

</A></H2>
Time reference specification is used, well,... to establish a reference
moment in time (for time offset to be applied to). When present, it should
come first, when omitted, it defaults to <STRONG>now</STRONG>. On its own part, time reference consists of <EM>time-of-day</EM> reference (which should come first, if present) and <EM>day</EM> reference.


<P>

<EM>Time-of-day</EM> can be specified as <STRONG>HH:MM</STRONG>, <STRONG>HH.MM</STRONG>, <STRONG>HHMM</STRONG>, or just <STRONG>HH</STRONG>, you can suffix it with <STRONG>am</STRONG> or <STRONG>pm</STRONG> or use 24-hours clock. The few special times of day are understood as well,
these include <STRONG>midnight</STRONG> (00:00), <STRONG>noon</STRONG> (12:00) and british
<STRONG>teatime</STRONG> (16:00).


<P>

The <EM>day</EM> can be specified as <EM>month-name</EM>  <EM>day-of-the-month</EM>
and optional 2- or 4-digit <EM>year</EM> number (e.g. March 8 1999). Alternatively, you can use <EM>day-of-week-name</EM> (e.g. Monday), or one of the words: <STRONG>yesterday</STRONG>, <STRONG>today</STRONG>, <STRONG>tomorrow</STRONG>. You can also specify <EM>day</EM> as a full date in several numerical formats; these include: <STRONG>MM/DD/[YY]YY</STRONG>, <STRONG>DD.MM.[YY]YY</STRONG>, <STRONG>DDMM[YY]YY</STRONG>
(<EM>NOTE1</EM>: this is different from the original <CODE>at(1)</CODE> behavior, which
interprets a single-number date as MMDD[YY]YY)
<EM>NOTE2</EM>: if you specify <EM>day</EM> this way, the <EM>time-of-day</EM> is REQUIRED to be present in front of it.


<P>

Finally, you can use words <STRONG>now</STRONG>, <STRONG>start</STRONG>, or <STRONG>end</STRONG> as your time reference. <STRONG>Now</STRONG> refers to the current moment (and is also a default time reference). <STRONG>Start</STRONG> (<STRONG>end</STRONG>) can be used to specify time relative to the start (end) time for those
tools that use these categories (rrdfetch, rrdgraph).


<P>

Month and weekday names can be used in their naturally abbreviated form
(e.g., Dec for December, Sun for Sunday, etc.). The words <STRONG>now</STRONG>,
<STRONG>start</STRONG>, <STRONG>end</STRONG> can be abbreviated to <STRONG>n</STRONG>, <STRONG>s</STRONG>, <STRONG>e</STRONG>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="TIME_OFFSET_SPECIFICATION">TIME OFFSET SPECIFICATION

</A></H2>
Time offset specification is used to add (or substract) certain time
interval to (from) the time reference moment. It consists of <EM>sign</EM>
(<STRONG>+</STRONG>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<STRONG>-</STRONG>) and <EM>amount</EM>. The following time units can be used to specify the <EM>amount</EM>: <STRONG>years</STRONG>, <STRONG>months</STRONG>, <STRONG>weeks</STRONG>, <STRONG>days</STRONG>,
<STRONG>hours</STRONG>, <STRONG>minutes</STRONG>, <STRONG>seconds</STRONG>, these can be used in singular or plural form, and abbreviated naturally
or to a single letter (e.g. +3days, -1wk, -3y). Several time units can be
combined together (e.g., -5mon1w2d), as well as several time offsets can be
concatenated (e.g., -5h45min = -5h-45min = -6h+15min = -7h+1h30m-15min,
etc.)


<P>

<EM>NOTE3</EM>: If you specify time offset in days, weeks, months, or years, you will end
with the time offset that may vary depending on you time reference, because
all those time units have no single well defined time interval value (1&nbsp;year contains either 365 or 366 days, 1&nbsp;month
is 28 to 31 days long, and even 1&nbsp;day may be not equal to 24 hours twice a year, when DST-related clock
adjustments take place). To cope with this, when you use days, weeks,
months, or years as your time offset units your time reference date is
adjusted accordingly without taking too much further effort to ensure
anything about it (in the hope that <CODE>mktime(3)</CODE> will take care
of this later). This may lead to some surprising (or even invalid!)
results, e.g. 'May&nbsp;31&nbsp;-1month' = 'Apr&nbsp;31' (meaningless) = 'May&nbsp;1'
(after <CODE>mktime(3)</CODE> normalization); in the EET timezone '3:30am
Mar 29 1999 -1 day' yields '3:30am Mar 28 1999' (Sunday) which is invalid
time/date combination (because of 3am -&gt; 4am DST forward clock
ajustment, see the below example). On the other hand, hours, minutes, and
seconds are well defined time intervals, and these are guaranteed to always
produce time offsets exactly as specified (e.g. for EET timezone, '8:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;27&nbsp;1999&nbsp;+2&nbsp;days' =
'8:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;29&nbsp;1999', but since there is 1-hour DST forward clock adjustment takes place around 3:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;28&nbsp;1999, the actual time interval between
8:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;27&nbsp;1999 and 8:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;29&nbsp;1999 equals 47 hours; on the other hand,
'8:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;27&nbsp;1999&nbsp;+48&nbsp;hours' = '9:00&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;29&nbsp;1999', as expected)


<P>

<EM>NOTE4</EM>: The single-letter abbreviation for both <STRONG>months</STRONG> and <STRONG>minutes</STRONG>
is <STRONG>m</STRONG>. To disambiguiate, the parser tries to read your mind&nbsp;:)
by applying the following two heuristics:


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
If <STRONG>m</STRONG> is used in context of (i.e. right after the) years, months, weeks, or days
it is assumed to mean <STRONG>months</STRONG>, while in the context of hours, minutes, and seconds it means minutes.
(e.g., in -1y6m or +3w1m <STRONG>m</STRONG> means <STRONG>months</STRONG>, while in -3h20m or +5s2m <STRONG>m</STRONG> means <STRONG>minutes</STRONG>)


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Out of context (i.e. right after the <STRONG>+</STRONG> or <STRONG>-</STRONG> sign) the meaning of <STRONG>m</STRONG> is guessed from the number it directly follows. Currently, if the number
absolute value is below 25 it is assumed that <STRONG>m</STRONG> means <STRONG>months</STRONG>, otherwise it is treated as <STRONG>minutes</STRONG>. (e.g., -25m == -25 minutes, while +24m == +24 months)


<P>

</OL>
<EM>Final NOTES</EM>: Time specification is case-insensitive. Whitespace can be inserted freely
or omitted altogether, there are, however, cases when whitespace is
required (e.g., 'midnight&nbsp;Thu'). In this case you should either quote the whole phrase to prevent it from
bieng taken apart by your shell or use '_' (underscore) or ',' (comma)
which also count as whitespace (e.g., midnight_Thu or midnight,Thu)
