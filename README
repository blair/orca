ORCA
=====

Orca is a tool useful for plotting arbitrary data from text files onto
a directory on a Web server.  It has the following features:

    * Creates an HTML tree of HTML and image (PNG or GIF) files.
    * Creates an index of URL links listing all available targets.
    * Creates an index of URL links listing all different plot types.
    * No separate CGI set up required.
    * Can be run under cron or it can sleep itself waiting for file updates
      based on when the file was last updated.
    * Configuration file based.
    * Reads arbitrarily formatted text or binary data files.
    * Watches data files for updates and sleeps between reads.
    * Finds new files at specified times.
    * Remembers the last modification times for files so they do not have to
      be reread continuously.
    * Allows arbitrary grouping of data from different files into the same
      or different plots.
    * Allows arbitrary math performed on data read from one file.

An example of the output generated by Orca is located at:

Orca is written completely in Perl.  To install, configure and use Orca,
read the INSTALL file.  Some sample configuration files for Orca can be
found in the lib directory.

For an overview of the design decisions that made Orca what it is today,
read the article

Orca is based on the RRDtool written by Tobias Oetiker.  To really
understand Orca and how it saves and manages your data, you should
understand RRDtool, which serves as the backend binary data filestore.
I recommend reading the documentation that comes with RRDtool.  It will
explain how the data files Orca uses are created, maintained, and used
to create the images that Orca creates.  Read about RRDtool at

DATA COLLECTION TOOLS
=====================

Orca does not generate the data itself that it plots.  This is left for
other programs.  Currently only one such data gathering and measuring
program is included here with Orca.

    orcallator.se
    ==============

    The other tool in this package is an updated version of
    orcallator.se written by Adrian Cockcroft.  Percollator.se
    is a tool written for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 that
    collects a large amount of system and web server statistics
    and prints them into a file for later processing and plotting.
    For documentation on the original orcallator.se tool, see the URL
    http://www.sunworld.com/swol-03-1996/swol-03-perf.html

    This version of orcallator.se collects much more data than the
    original on Solaris systems.  I have designed an Orca configuration
    file designed to read the output of this orcallator.  Sample output
    from this set up is displayed at

    http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~blair/orca/orca-example/

    Documentation on the data that orcallator.se collects can be viewed at

MAILING LISTS
=============

Four mailing lists exist for Orca.  To subscribe to any of the mailing
lists, please visit the URL listed below.  You have the option of choosing
a digest form of the mailing list if you wish it when you subscribe to
the mailing list or anytime thereafter.  To send email to any of these
lists you must subscribe to the list.

orca-announce@onelist.com
    Subscribe    http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/orca-announce
    Archive      http://www.onelist.com/archive/orca-announce

    This is a LOW volume moderated mailing list for announcing stable
    releases of Orca.

orca-users@onelist.com
    Subscribe    http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/orca-users
    Archive      http://www.onelist.com/archive/orca-users

    This mailing list is a first stop mailing list for getting help
    in setting up and getting Orca running.  Problems relating to
    downloading, configuring, compiling the necessary Perl modules,
    and installing Orca belong here.  People interested anything more
    than this, such as developing data gathering modules or active Perl
    development, should be on one or both of the following mailing lists.
    Once you get Orca running to your satisfaction, you may want to
    remove yourself from this list.

orca-discuss@onelist.com
    Subscribe    http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/orca-discuss
    Archive      http://www.onelist.com/archive/orca-discuss

    This mailing list is for active users of Orca who are doing new
    interesting things with Orca and want to discuss Orca but are not
    interested in actively developing Orca source code.  These people
    are also not interested in helping people get Orca running on their
    systems.

orca-developers@onelist.com
    Subscribe    http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/orca-developers
    Archive      http://www.onelist.com/archive/orca-developers

    This mailing list is for people who are interested in actively
    developing, fixing and improving Orca's source code and related data
    gathering modules, and porting Orca to new platforms.

INSTALLATION
============

Read and follow the installation steps in INSTALL.

AUTHOR
======

These two tools were written by Blair Zajac.  I welcome any patches for
bugs or improvements, comments and suggestions.  Please send any Orca
correspondence to orca-users@onelist.com or orca-developers@onelist.com,
which I read and participate on.

If you wish to contact me directly, my email address is bzajac@akamai.com.

NAMING OF ORCA
==============

I originally named Orca FMRTG, but after asking my wife
http://www.rothschildimage.com for some suggestions, she came up with
Orca.  It turns out that there are only one or two small programs on
the Internet named Orca, so we both were happy to hear this.
