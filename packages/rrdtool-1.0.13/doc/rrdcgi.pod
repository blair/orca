=head1 NAME

rrdcgi - create web pages containing RRD graphs based on templates

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#!/path/to/B<rrdcgi> 
S<[B<--goodfor>|B<-g> I<seconds>]>
S<[B<--filter>]>
S<[B<--refresh>|B<-r>]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rrdcgi> is a sort of very limited script interpreter. Its purpose
is to run as a cgi-program and parse a web page template containing special
E<lt>RRD:: tags. B<rrdcgi> will interpret and act according to these tags.
In the end it will printout a web page including the necessary CGI headers.

B<rrdcgi> parses the contents of the template in 2 steps. In each step it looks
only for a subset of tags. This allows to nest tags. 

The argument parser uses the same semantics as you are used from your c shell.

=item B<--goodfor>|B<-g> I<seconds>

Specify the number of seconds this page should remain valid. This will prompt
the rrdcgi to output a Last-Modified and a Expire header.

=item B<--filter>

Assume that rrdcgi is being run as a filter and not as a cgi.

=item B<--refresh>|B<-r>

If the B<--goodfor> flag is specified, then B<--refresh> will cause rrdcgi
to output a Refresh header with the value of the B<--goodfor> value.

=item RRD::CV I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name.

=item RRD::CV::QUOTE I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name but quotes it, ready for
use as an argument in another RRD:: tag. So even when there are spaces in the
value of the CGI variable it will still be considered as one argument.

=item RRD::CV::PATH I<name>

Inserts the CGI variable of the given name, quotes it and makes sure
the it starts neither with a '/' nor contains '..'. This is to make
sure that no problematic pathnames can be introduced through the 
CGI interface.

=item RRD::INCLUDE I<filename>

Include the contents of the given file into the page returned from the cgi

=item RRD::GRAPH I<rrdgraph arguments>

This tag creates the RRD graph defined in its argument and then gets
replaced by an appropriate E<lt>IMGE<gt> tag referring to the graph.
The B<--lazy> option in RRD graph can be used to make sure that graphs
are only regenerated when they are out of date. The arguments
to the B<RRD::GRAPH> tag work as described in the B<rrdgraph> manual page.

Use the B<--lazy> option in your RRD::GRAPH tags, to reduce the load
on your server. This option makes sure that graphs are only regenerated when
the old ones are out of date.

If you do not specify your own B<--imginfo> format, the following will
be used:

 <IMG SRC="%s" WIDTH="%lu" HEIGHT="%lu">

Note that %s stands for the filename part of the graph generated, all
directories given in the GIF file argument will get dropped.

=item RRD::PRINT I<number>

If the preceding  B<RRD::GRAPH> tag contained and B<PRINT> arguments,
then you can access their output with this tag. The I<number> argument refers to the
number of the B<PRINT> argument. This first B<PRINT> has I<number> 0.

=head1 EXAMPLE

The example below creates a web pages with a single RRD graph.

 #!/usr/local/bin/rrdcgi
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <H1>RRDCGI Example Page</H1>
 <P>
 <RRD::GRAPH demo.gif --lazy --title="Temperatures"
          DEF:cel=demo.rrd:exhaust:AVERAGE
          LINE2:cel#00a000:"D. Celsius">

 </P>
 </BODY>
 </HTML>

=head1 EXAMPLE 2

This script is slightly more elaborate, it allows you to run it from 
a form which sets RRD_NAME. RRD_NAME is then used to select which RRD
you want to use a source for your graph.

 #!/usr/local/bin/rrdcgi
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>RRDCGI Demo</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <H1>RRDCGI Example Page for <RRD::CV RRD_NAME></H1>
 <H2>Selection</H2>
 <FORM><INPUT NAME=RRD_NAME TYPE=RADIO VALUE=roomA> Room A,
       <INPUT NAME=RRD_NAME TYPE=RADIO VALUE=roomB> Room B.
       <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT></FORM>
 <H2>Graph</H2>
 <P>
 <RRD::GRAPH <RRD::CV::PATH RRD_NAME>.gif --lazy 
          --title "Temperatures for "<RRD::CV::QUOTE RRD_NAME>
          DEF:cel=<RRD::CV::PATH RRD_NAME>.rrd:exhaust:AVERAGE
          LINE2:cel#00a000:"D. Celsius">

 </P>
