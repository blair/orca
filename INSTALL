1) Install Perl 5.005_02.

   I have used only version version 5.005_02 of Perl with Orca.
   Because Orca makes very heavy use of references, it may or may not
   work with older versions of Perl.  I welcome feedback if Orca works
   with older Perls.

   This step is too large to go into here.  The bottom line is to
   follow the instructions at

      http://language.perl.com/info/software.html

2) Install necessary Perl modules.
   a) Install Math::IntervalSearch version 1.00 or greater.

      Download Math::IntervalSearch from either:

         ftp://ftp.gps.caltech.edu/pub/blair/Perl/Math-Interpolate-1.01.tar.gz
         http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/B/BZ/BZAJAC/Math-Interpolate-1.01.tar.gz

      % gunzip -c Math-Interpolate-1.01.tar.gz | tar xvf -
      % cd Math-Interpolate-1.01
      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make
      % make test
      % make install

   b) Install Digest::MD5 version 2.00 or greater.

      Download Digest::MD5 from:

         http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/GAAS/Digest-MD5-2.02.tar.gz

      % gunzip -c Digest-MD5-2.02.tar.gz | tar xvf -
      % cd Digest-MD5-2.02
      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make
      % make test
      % make install

   c) Install RRDs version 0.99.6 or greater.

      Download RRDs from:

         http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/pub/

      % gunzip -c rrdtool-?.??.?.tar.gz | tar xvf -
      % cd rrdtool-?.??.?
      % sh configure --verbose
      % make                                [ To optimize: make CFLAGS=-O ]
      % cd perl-shared
      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make                                [ To optimize: make OPTIMIZE=-O ]
      % make test
      % make install

      For large installations, I recommend that RRD be compiled with
      optimization turned on.

3) Decide where Orca's binaries, RRD, HTML, and percollator directories
   will reside.  Make sure performance concerns are handled.

   First choose the location where Orca will be installed.  By default,
   Orca will install into the following structure:

   $prefix                      Prefix, set with --prefix=
   $prefix/bin                  Binaries, set with --bindir=
   $prefix/lib                  Libraries, set with --libdir=
   $prefix/man                  Manual pages, set with --mandir=
   $prefix/var/orca/rrd         RRD directory, set with --with-rrd-dir
   $prefix/var/orca/percollator Percollator directory, set with --with-perc-dir

   By default $prefix is set to /usr/local.  The -- arguments shown
   above should be given to the configure script described below which
   configures Orca.  If you want to change the installation location of
   Orca, say into /opt/orca, you would do so by passing --prefix=/opt/orca
   to the configure script.

   Because Orca is extremely IO intensive, I recommend that the host
   that locally mounts the web server content be the same machine that
   runs Orca.  In addition, the RRD data files that Orca uses also
   require a good amount of IO.  The machine running Orca should always
   have the $prefix/var/rrd directory locally mounted.  For performance
   concerns it is more important this directory be locally stored than
   HTML directory where the resulting HTML and GIF files are written.

   If you are going to use the percollator Orca addon to monitor your
   Sun Solaris systems, then you will in addition need to decide where
   to have percollator store its data files.  By default, these data
   files are written to once every 5 minutes, so IO is not an issue.
   The issue here is that percollator needs to run as root and all of
   the percollator output files from all your hosts need to be written
   into the same NFS shared directory that Orca can read.  It is not too
   important that the directory that percollator writes into be mounted
   locally on the machine that Orca will run on, since Orca will only
   read each file every five minutes.

   If you are running percollator on a system running a web, proxy,
   or Squid server, you can have percollator watch the logs generated
   by these programs.  In this case, note the location of the log file
   for the configure script.

4) Configure Orca.

   Now that you have decided where the RRD, HTML, and optionally the
   percollator data files and the web server access logs, are located,
   run the configure script with the following arguments:

   % ./configure --prefix=ORCA_PREFIX_DIRECTORY \
                 --with-rrd-dir=RRD_DIR_LOCATION \
                 --with-html-dir=HTML_DIR_LOCATION \
                 --with-perc-dir=PERCOLLATOR_DIR_LOCATION \
                 --with-TYPE-log=LOG_LOCATION

   If you choose nothing else, the --with-html-dir must always be used.

   If you use a web, proxy, or Squid server, you can have percollator
   gather statistics from the log file.  Use this table to decide which
   configure option to use:

   Log Type                                    Configure Option
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   NCSA/Common Log Format                      --with-ncsa-log=FILE
   Common Log Format with Proxy Information    --with-proxy-log=FILE
   Squid Log Format                            --with-squid-log=FILE

   Configure will let you use only one of these --with-TYPE-log options.

   The configure script will find where your version of Perl and some
   other assorted programs are located.

5) Install Orca.

   Now run make and make install:

   % make
   % make install

6) [Optional] Install percollator.
   a) Install the SE toolkit.

      Perform the installation instructions as listed on the web page

         http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/performance/se3/

      If you are running 2.6 or greater, then download SE 3.1 or greater.
      Otherwise you will need SE 3.0.

   b) Apply a patch to the SE 3.0 toolkit.  If you are running any other
      release of SE, then do not install the patch.

      By default the SE toolkit will install into /opt/RICHPse.
      Run this command:

      % cd /opt/RICHPse
      % patch -s < THIS_DIR/patches/p_netstat_class.se.diff

   c) Examine Orca/percollator programs.

      Orca's installation scripts also installs several programs and
      configuration files necessary to have Orca monitor many different
      statistics of your Sun Solaris systems.

      The following tools are installed in the $prefix/bin directory:

         start_percol   - start percollator on a system
         stop_precol    - stop percollator on a system
         restart_percol - restart percollator on a system
         percol_column  - print selected columns from percollator output
         percol_running - run to see if any percollators are not running

   d) Run start_percol on all systems.

      Log in as root on all the systems you want to watch and run:

      % $prefix/bin/start_percol

   e) Edit percollator.cfg.

      You need to edit the installed percollator.cfg file and remove
      all unneeded references.  In particular, you'll want to change
      warn_email, which is the email address that receives emails when
      percollator generated files are out of date, which may signify a
      percollator program that has died and is no longer gathering data.

   f) Run Orca.

      Log into the system that will run Orca and run the command:

      % cd $prefix
      % ./bin/orca -v lib/percollator.cfg
