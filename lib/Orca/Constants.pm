# ORCA_VER_MAJOR        Orca's major version number.  Increment when
#                       incompatible changes are made to published
#                       interfaces.
# ORCA_VER_MINOR        Orca's minor version number.  Increment when
#                       new functionality is added or new interfaces
#                       are defined, but all changes are backward
#                       compatible.
# ORCA_VER_PATCH        Orca's patch version number.  Increment for
#                       every released patch.
# ORCA_VER_QUOTED       The variables $ORCA_VER_MAJOR,
#                       $ORCA_VER_MINOR and $ORCA_VER_PATCH
#                       joined with periods, i.e. "1.2.3".
# ORCA_VER_REVISION     The Subversion repository revision number of
#                       this release.  It remains 0 in the repository.
#                       When rolling a tarball, it is automatically
#                       replaced with a best guess to be the correct
#                       revision number.
# ORCA_VER_TAG          A string describing the version.  This tag
#                       remains " (dev $ORCA_VER_REVISION)" in the
#                       repository so that we can always see that the
#                       software has been built from the repository
#                       rather than a "blessed" version.  For snapshot
#                       releases, the variable is left unchanged.  For
#                       final releases, it is emptied.
# ORCA_VERSION          The real version of Orca.  Formed by the string
#                       "$ORCA_VER_QUOTED$ORCA_VER_TAG".
# ORCA_RRD_VERSION      This is the version number used in creating the DS
#                       names in RRDs.  This should be updated any time a
#                       new version of Orca needs some new content in its
#                       RRD files.  The DS name is a concatentation of the
#                       string Orca with this string of digits.
# DAY_SECONDS           The number of seconds in one day.
# IS_WIN32              If Orca is running on a Windows platform.

# used in the list of plots to create.  The second array holds the
# number of 300 second intervals are used to create a consolidated
# data point.  The third array is the number of consolidated data
# points held in the RRA.

# particular plots to create, such the monthly one.  In addition to
# the plot types that are structured in the RRD via its RRA's, there
# is an additional hourly plot that is listed before the daily plot
# and an additional quarterly plot (100 days) created between the
# monthly and yearly plots.  The quarterly plot is updated daily.
#
# For each plot type, the first value in the array reference is the
# number of 300 second intervals are used in a plot.  The second value
# is the number of seconds graphed in the plots.  Be careful to not
# increase the time interval so much that the number of data points to
# plot are greater than the number of pixels available for the image,
# otherwise there will be a 30% slowdown due to a reduction
# calculation to resample the data to the lower resolution for the
# plot.  For example, with 40 days of 2 hour data, there are 480 data
# points.  For no slowdown to occur, the image should be at least 481
