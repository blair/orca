Wed May 26 17:54:26 PDT 1999

	Release version 0.22.

Wed May 26 12:10:42 PDT 1999

	Move the portions of the code that generate the RRDs::graph
	options that do not change between invocations to the
	_update_graph_options method.  This method gets called when the
	Orca::GIFFile is constructed and any time add_rrds is called.
	This speeds Orca up slightly.

	Include RRDtool 0.99.31 but continue to only require 0.99.29.

	Add a new quarterly plot that shows the last 100 days.  This is
	a nice transition between the monthly and yearly plots.

	Change the number of days shown in the yearly plot from 500 to
	428, which is one year and two months.  Reducing the number
	of days from 500 by at least one day will speed up the GIF
	generation time because by default the plot portion of the GIFs
	are 500 pixels wide.

	Add two new classes Orca::Config::Plot and
	Orca::Config::FilesGroup that do not do anything yet but
	will provide an object-oriented interface to config_plots and
	config_files.  Currently all the values in @$config_plots and
	%$config_files are now bless objects instead of unblessed objects.

Thu May 20 10:59:26 PDT 1999

	Put a closing ) in a error message in RRDtool 0.99.29.1.

	Fix a bug in queue_data where it was sending data to
	rrd_update that was already in the RRD file.

Wed May 19 10:43:48 PDT 1999

	Restructured the code so each Orca::SourceDataFile has only
	one anonymous subroutine to read in all the valued from a single
	line of the source data file.  This sped Orca up slightly.

	Add a -r option to Orca to have it not create any HTML or
	GIF files and only update the RRD files.

	Fix a bug where if the number of columns changed in from one
	source file to the next source file in a files group, the
	column index used to get a particular value is the old index
	for the old file and not the new index for the new file.  This
	fix involved having the Orca::SourceDataFile object run the
	anonymous subroutines to pick the correct data from a line
	instead of Orca::RRDFile.

	Remove some unused methods: Orca::OpenFileHash::list,
	Orca::OpenFileHash::select, Orca::OpenFileHash::sysread_readline
	Add some more documentation to orcallator.cfg.

	Skip a line in an input source data file if the word timestamp
	is found in it.  This is a temporary fix.

Mon May 17 16:26:17 PDT 1999

	Release version 0.21.

Mon May 17 15:07:33 PDT 1999

	Correct a bug when a source data file cannot be loaded it should
	not used to look up a Orca::SourceDataFile object.

	Reformat all the comments in orca.pl.

Thu May 13 10:47:41 PDT 1999

	Orca used to delete RRD files if they had an $ORCA_RRD_VERSION
	number newer then the required version number.	Now use them.
	Add code to remember the Orca RRD version number so that the
	GIF creation code works properly with RRD files with a version
	different than $ORCA_RRD_VERSION.

	Thanks to a configure file and some data from from Eric Blaise
	<Eric.Blaise@socgen.com>, Orca can now handle plots containing
	columns of data that do not exist in all input source data files.

	In add_plots, a linear search was used to convert column
	description names appearing in data statements to an index into
	the column_description array.  Now use a hash table look up.

Wed May 12 09:31:43 PDT 1999

	Orca now cleans up all file paths in the input configuration file.
	If more than one / are found in a row, they are replaced by one /.
	The base_dir is only prepended to paths if the path does not
	match ^\\?\.{0,2}/, which will match on /, ./, ../, and \./.

	The paths used to find input files are now passed through
	the following regular expressions: s:^\\./:: and s:/\\./:/:g.
	These remove unneccessary searches through the current directory.

	Perl_glob will only return found files and no other type.
	It will also not follow any directories named `..'.

	Include RRDtool 0.99.29.1 with Orca.  This includes a Makefile
	patch and does not include a new version of RRDs.pm or librrd.

	In any Makefile.in's that run config.status, they used to run
	a make from the top level directory.  Now they only run a make
	from the directory that required the running of config.status.

Tue May 11 16:24:09 PDT 1999

	In places where deep copies of data structures are made and no
	s///'s are performed on the text form of data, use dclone that
	comes with Storable instead of using Data::Dumper and eval.

	Do not prepend base_dir to any paths if they begin with either
	`/' or `./'.

	Require and include RRDtool 0.99.29 with Orca.

	Orca now includes the four Perl packages it depends upon:
	Digest::MD5 2.07, Math::Interpolate 1.02, RRDtool 0.99.29,
	and Storable 0.6@3.

Mon May 10 10:46:36 PDT 1999

	Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.07 and require
	RRDtool 0.99.28.

Sat May  8 19:29:14 PDT 1999

	Upgrade the instructions to mention Math::Interpolate 1.02
	instead of Math::Interpolator 1.01.

Thu May  6 13:58:06 PDT 1999

	Orca does not normally display the daily, weekly, monthly,
	yearly, and everything plots for all the different measurements
	if there is only one group.  However, it is nice to see all the
	different measurement plots in one page for a single group, so if
	now there is only one group, then an Everything group placed at
	the top of the main index.html file for daily, weekly, monthly,
	and yearly overviews.

	Make a comment about using gd1.3 versus gd1.2 in INSTALL when
	building RRDtool.  Because RRDtool comes with gd1.2 and generates
	smaller GIFs, a comment is made that there is no reason to move
	to gd1.3.  The bottom line is that gd1.2 is preferred.

	Check if the state file is empty and do not complain if it is.

	Add installation instructions that to install this version
	of Orca over an older version, a make migrate command will
	need to be run to renames all files and directories containing
	percollator, percol, or perc to orcallator in any of the installed
	Orca directories.

	Update orcallator.cfg to look for filenames like
	orcallator-1999-05-06 and percol-1999-05-06.

Wed May  5 10:43:23 PDT 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.27.

Mon May  3 14:51:06 PDT 1999

	Rename everything percollator, perc and percol to orcallator.

Fri Apr 30 16:34:20 PDT 1999

	Update to install Perl 5.005_03 instead of 5.005_02.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.23.

Wed Mar 31 19:07:41 PST 1999

	When perl_glob cannot open a directory, return an empty
	array and warn instead of dying.  Fix from J.R. Tietsort
	<jrtietsort@micron.com>.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.22 which contains a memory leak bug fix.

Sat Mar 27 10:07:09 PST 1999

	Update references to Digest::MD5 version 2.06 and require
	RRDtool 0.99.21.

Thu Mar 25 15:30:00 PST 1999

	Speed up count_proc() in percollator.se by 20% using a patch
	supplied by Rich Pettit <rpettit@resolute.com>.

	Add another consolidation function, DERIVE, to an error message.

	Change the user, system and idle colors in the CPU usage plot
	as requested by Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.

	Change the printing format of usr% and sys% from %4.0f to %5.1f
	in percollator.se to work around a printing problem reported by
	Alain Swanson <amswanson@micron.com>.  In SE 3.1 this will now
	display an extra non-zero digit of measured precision.

	Always output the header information in percollator.se, even
	if Orca cannot handle it yet, since the number of columns may
	change if new hardware is added to the system.

Mon Feb 22 10:23:21 PST 1999

	Add GIF width and height tags to img src's using the returned
	GIF size from RRDs::graph.

	Add a space between the ending " for the img src="" and the
	following alt="" in the generated HTML.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.14.

	Add x86 Ethernet device plotting to percollator.cfg.in.

	Remove the LAST RRA from all Orca created RRAs since it is not
	required to get the current value from an RRA.	The current
	value is obtained by using the LAST consolidation function on
	the plotted data.

Sun Feb 21 11:03:39 PST 1999

	Make use of RRDtool 0.99.12's legend formatting.

Sat Feb 20 20:13:01 PST 1999

	Version 0.19.

	Fix a bug in copying SE 3.1's percollator.se changes where it
	was not skipping the HTTP/1.x code in the NCSA style access log.
	Now percollator.se can handle log files with or without the code.

Thu Feb 18 11:54:03 PST 1999

	percollator.se now logs information on integral multiples of
	the interval.  This is useful for RRD which expects data to be
	measured on the interval.

	Fix a bug in percollator.se where it was inflating the httpops5
	number since it was not calculating the actual time interval
	and instead assuming a 5 second interval.

	Add Squid log processing to percollator.se courtesy of Adrian
	Cockcroft of Sun Microsystems.

	Rename the configure --with options.  If you want to watch NCSA
	style access logs, use --with-ncsa-log.  To watch NCSA style
	proxy access logs, use --with-proxy-log.  And to watch Squid
	access log, use --with-squid-log.

Wed Feb 17 17:37:35 PST 1999

	Add rrdtool.gif to the GIF files that Orca creates and include
	a HREF to rrdtool.gif in every HTML file that Orca generates.

Tue Feb 16 10:49:07 PST 1999

	Version 0.18.

	Minor fixes.

	Version 0.17.

	Group names are now sorted depending upon the format of the
	group names.  For example, this now will list nfs13 after nfs5,
	even though cmp will sort nfs13 before nfs5.

	Created GIFs now print the current measured value in addition
	to the average measured value.

	percollator.cfg.in updated to shorten the http and inode with
	page steals legends to have shorter legends so that RRDtool will
	plot the whole comment along with the average and last value in
	the GIF.

Mon Feb 15 12:29:18 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.11.

	Add versioning information to the DS names created by Orca so new
	versions of Orca can make older RRD files obsolete.  This feature
	is now used to make sure that the current measurement using LAST
	is stored in Orca's RRDs.

Fri Feb 12 15:10:05 PST 1999

	Require RRDtool 0.99.10.

	When creating a brand new RRD, create new RRAs for the current
	value measured using the LAST DS type.

Thu Jan 28 15:44:07 PST 1999

	If a file uses the first line as a column description and if
	the following line does not have the same number of columns,
	then warn and skip that line.

	Require RRDtool 0.99.4.

Tue Jan 26 15:28:26 PST 1999

	Rename Orca::GIFFile::expire_string to
	Orca::GIFFile::_expire_string.

	Change the default location of the percollator RRDs to be
	$prefix/var/orca/rrd/percollator instead of $prefix/var/orca/rrd.

	Sort the order of RRD files being updated by the RRD's filename.

	Do not make RRD_DIR/percollator

	Version 0.16.

	Fix a bug in lib/Makefile.in where the variable $(CP) was used
	but never defined.

	Fix a bug where watch_data_sources() would do an extra loop each
	time file updates were looked for.

Mon Jan 25 15:25:12 PST 1999

	each HTML file.  The logo is stored as hexadecimal inside the
	Orca perl script.

	Update percollator.cfg.in to not contain bzajac@geostaff.com
	any more.  Changed it to root@localhost.

Thu Jan 21 13:31:50 PST 1999

	Add a configure script to Orca to make installation of Orca and
	percollator much easier.

	Add a new file env_percol to set up all the environmental
	variables so that percollator runs correctly instead of having
	to edit start_percol, stop_percol, and restart_percol.

Mon Jan 11 16:58:28 PST 1999

Thu Dec 10 16:47:20 PST 1998

	Add percol_column to the list of programs in the percollator
	directory.  This program makes it easy to read several columns of
	data from a percollator.se output file instead of trying to look
	at 1000 character lines that percollator.se generally outputs.

Thu Dec 10 12:50:19 PST 1998

	Version 0.13.

	Found an extra loop in creating the HTML files.  They are now
